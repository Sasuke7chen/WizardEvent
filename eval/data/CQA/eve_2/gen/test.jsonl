However, the COVID-19 pandemic illustrates one negative of this move, in that the acquiring business is significantly more macro sensitive than FIS' legacy operations. Although cost synergies from the acquisition appear to have helped the company maintain its margins, the pandemic has resulted in a meaningful revenue decline. But results from FIS and peers suggests payment volumes have steadily improved from April lows, and payment volumes are returning to year-to-year growth.

Now that Coloplast already has shifted most of its production to Hungary and China, we anticipate smaller margin gains going forward. We project that Coloplast can incrementally increase operating margin to 33.7% by 2024, as slight gains in manufacturing efficiency prevail over more investment in research and development programs, which nets out to 9% average annual growth in operating income during the same period.

We see the main risks around Plains to be volumetric on both the supply and demand sides, and shortfalls could lead to lower returns via tougher pipe-on-pipe competition and lower levels of flows across Plains' pipeline network. Given Plains' large Permian exposure, lower-than-expected production from this particular basin would be meaningful for its results.

We project adjusted EBITDA margin to expand by about five percentage points between 2020 and 2025, as the same technological factor that leads to deflationary pricing reduces Cogent's network costs. The firm also benefits from substantial operating leverage, as additional connections on its existing network have around a 95% margin. Since Cogent does not own or have to maintain the fiber in its network, capital spending consists primarily of equipment and lease payments.

For example, in iron ore, the unit capital cost for capacity expansions in 2002 was about USD 40 per tonne; however, at the peak of the boom it hit in excess of USD 200 per tonne, largely coinciding with peak capital spending for BHP. In the more sedate demand environment, incremental capacity can be added for very low capital costs through incremental expansions and efficiencies, including innovative technology such as automated haulage.

While growth is not in and of itself evidence of a competitive advantage, it does allow Chipotle to generate scale over advertising expenditure, supply chain and quality assurance investments, (relatively) fixed labor and rent expenditure, and sustained investments in the technology stack, allowing the firm to more effectively compete with larger QSR peers. Finally, though marketing expenses jumped sharply in 2016 (as the firm relied on free meals and discounting to drive traffic after food safety concerns), we note that trailing five-year figures of 2.5% of system sales are materially lower than wide-moat McDonald's (4%), wide-moat Yum!

{"context": "For instance, Airbus' A320 family of aircraft was introduced in 1988 and Boeing's 737 program was introduced in 1968, both of which continue to be the best-selling aircraft globally. As manufacturers would need to freeze production, redesign, and test the aircraft before the product would be usable by customers, manufacturers have little incentive to certify a new supplier for the product, particularly because the markup manufacturers pay for the original product is much less than the markup airlines pay for spare parts. In many cases, products are certified during the original design of the aircraft, and TransDigm becomes the sole-source supplier for the life of the aircraft. The tendency for manufacturers to reduce the cost of aircraft design by using derivative (such as Airbus' A320neo and Boeing's 737 MAX), rather than clean-sheet new aircraft, reduces the probability that a particular component will be recompeted in the redesign. After second-quarter earnings, we are increasing our fair value to $564 from $553 due to the time value of money and slightly higher medium-term margin targets, though these increases are partially offset by a slightly deeper revenue trough in fiscal 2021.

Thus, it is extremely difficult for startups to replicate the many years of analog expertise held by incumbents. Leading analog chipmakers also face stringent quality requirements in some end markets, such as the automotive industry, for example, where defects can only be tolerated as low as one part per million. Although the analog chip market is quite fragmented, it would be difficult for any startup to achieve this level of quality while still being to satisfy high volume production.

Beyond incurring elevated COVID-19 costs (related to safety, labor, and logistics), Kellogg has also opted to turn up the spigot on brand spending (which had been tempered in the first half, given outsize demand that was met by supply constraints), which we view as favorable--illustrating that it's more concerned about supporting the business' long-term health than meeting short-term profit aims.

Therefore, having high-quality tenants improves the quality of the mall, which traditionally has attracted more higher-quality tenants to the mall.

The firm's recent investments in modernizing US stores to fit the \"Experience of the Future,\" in tandem with the rollout of a new line of chicken sandwiches in February, leave us confident that management is making the proper investments in the brand and the menu, solidifying the firm's brand intangible asset and adroitly adapting to changing consumer expectations. Turning to the firm's cost advantage, we believe that McDonald's commanding scale allows it to benefit from volume discounts in food and paper procurement from food distributors, fixed-cost leverage in general and administrative, marketing and technology spending, and lower rates on third-party operator (3PO) platforms. With respect to procurement relationships, QSR operators primarily value cost and on-time delivery. Larger case volumes per store help food distributors manage delivery costs per case, particularly with expensive last-mile delivery, while in-house technological capabilities offer chains the advantage of paying for food products without added services such as inventory management, promotional strategies, or consulting services.", "question": "Why in-house technological capabilities is useful?", "lab": "the advantage of paying for food products without added services such as inventory management, promotional strategies, or consulting services"}

Transportation by truck costs roughly $0.15-$0.35 per ton-mile, limiting the potential range of deliveries to roughly 70 miles or less before transportation costs begin to exceed the cost of the aggregate itself. With most quarries lacking efficient water or rail alternatives, markets tend to be highly localized and face minimal threats from distant competition.

According to the American Medical Association, the share of local insurance markets in the US that were highly concentrated grew to 74% in 2019 from 71% in 2014, with the leaders likely taking share in those markets due to local market dynamics. For example, in communities where Cigna already has substantial market share, the company typically aims to increase its influence by offering lower costs or more benefits per member to existing and potential clients. If that offering is compelling enough, more employers will be attracted to Cigna's insurance plans in those communities, and local service providers, such as hospitals and physician groups, will have more incentive to join Cigna's insurance networks to gain access to the large, growing membership rolls. As Cigna's local market share rises, its negotiating leverage with providers also rises, which can create a virtuous cycle where Cigna attracts even more clients and more providers to its insurance network.

Profit metrics were constrained in the third quarter (with adjusted gross margins up a mere 10 basis points to 34.6% and adjusted operating margins down 150 basis points to 11.7%), but we don't think this means the firm is prioritizing top-line gains at any cost. Rather, even though it continues to incur elevated COVID-19 costs (related to safety, labor, and logistics), Kellogg is opting to turn up the spigot on brand spending (which had been tempered in the first half, given outsize demand that was met by supply constraints), which we view as favorable--illustrating that it's more concerned about supporting the business' long-term health than meeting short-term profit aims. We continue to believe gross margins will approximate the low to mid-30s in fiscal 2020, while operating margins will hover in the low teens. We still forecast the firm will expend more than 7% of sales, or around $1 billion annually, on research, development, and marketing over the next 10 years.

Furthermore, failures of critical parts that render a vehicle immobile require immediate replacement for drivers to regain the use of a car or truck operated for commuting or commercial endeavors. Few digital retailers can combine depth of inventory with speed of delivery. For this reason, a Tire Rack-like model (where the customer buys tires online and has them shipped to an approved shop for installation) is less likely to succeed for failure-related parts that require immediate replacement.

We assign cost advantage moat sources to both Pepsi and Coke based on their ability to leverage superior volumes to reduce fixed costs per unit and variable costs per unit through superior procurement.

Simply put, in replicating a network of planes, trucks, sorting facilities, and skilled employees, a new entrant would face massive investment before it could win a critical volume of customers from the entrenched incumbents. Efficient scale applies in this context because a new entrant would have no choice but to replicate UPS' sprawling asset base in the absence of economic package flow, yielding a long period of painful losses.

Combined, three of the biggest constituents of the toy market--Mattel, Hasbro, and Lego--control less than 30% of the very fragmented US toy space, which constitutes around 30% of the global market. The significant market share represented by these companies, along with the licensing and entertainment relationships already contracted by these industry incumbents, is enough to make most would-be competitors skeptical about entering the marketplace and directly competing for new licensing contracts, as Mattel, Hasbro, and Lego have more advertising dollars to offer. Its position as one of the largest toy companies allows Mattel to capture these partnerships with relative ease, as the company is a top choice for any partner to pair with, having one of the widest reaches and the deepest marketing pockets across the toy marketer space. Mattel's toy business is somewhat more capital-intensive than traditional retailing, thanks to the manufacturing segment and the length of the inventory cycle, which ties up working capital; both issues have become less concerning in recent years, as Mattel becomes more asset light and as retailers take inventory closer to demand.

As mass merchants and online retailers have enhanced their consumer electronic product assortments and OEMs built out their own retail and direct-to-consumer channels, suppliers have become less dependent on Best Buy for distribution, in our view. Although stores-within-stores and other partnerships with Google, Samsung, Microsoft, Sony, and Amazon indicate that consumer electronics OEMs still view Best Buy as a viable product distribution channel, we harbor longer-term concerns that these manufacturers will find ways to bypass the traditional retail direct-sales model and expand their own direct-to-consumer presence (including greater exclusivity for new product launches and trade-in plans like Apple's iPhone upgrade program), extracting a greater proportion of the economic profits from each consumer electronics transaction in the process. Additionally, consumer electronic products are often differentiated by price, making industry players like Amazon and Walmart threats to Best Buy's market position. With consumer electronics likely to become more relevant to consumers over the next several years through connected home and other technology trends, we expect price competition to intensify, likely keeping some pressure on Best Buy's margins.

Five Below has achieved its current standing relatively quickly, growing from 82 stores at the end of fiscal 2008 to its current footprint (900 units at the end of fiscal 2019), and the lack of switching costs in the sector makes it difficult to believe that another retailer would be unable to duplicate the performance. While the firm's 12% average adjusted operating margin over the past three years exceeds narrow-moat Dollar General's 9% level, we attribute much of this differential to mix, as the latter chain's consumables offerings (which include widely available products such as paper and cleaning products, packaged and perishable foods, pet foods, and tobacco) are likely margin-dilutive, with a similar range of items available at most similarly sized general retailers.

For example, the confluence of being preeminently exposed to the US, and the intermediated go-to-market approach that the country's regulations mandate, means that the firm cannot own any portion of its distribution apparatus. The inability to benefit from dense distribution routes, more holistically leverage economies of scope, or remove the wholesalers' profit margin from its cost structure, limits the number of avenues through which a cost advantage can manifest for the company and reduces the extent to which it can contribute to rent creation. Parallel to this reality, in our view, is Boston Beer's relatively less leeway to influence its wholesalers given the more fragmented nature of high-end malt beverages.

Such efforts can boost operating margins meaningfully, as seen in results at both Home Depot and Lowe's in the past. Despite the strides made, investments to improve the Tractor experience (via side-lot expansion in garden and project fusion investments to increase productivity) could constrain near-term operating margin expansion. However, over time, improved gross margin results from strong private-label penetration and better operating expense leverage from scale gains could lead to operating margins that rise marginally every year, leading to 10% long-term metrics, in line with the 10% captured in 2020.", "question": "Why scale gains is useful?", "lab": "better operating expense leverage"}

Regardless of revenue earned from premium subscribers or advertising, Spotify must pay record labels and publishers a royalty for the content streamed to its users. Without any ownership of the more than 35 million tracks currently in its library, Spotify, along with other music streaming providers, will remain significantly dependent on record labels, which it will continue to pay for content consumption. Spotify has guided for a long-term gross margin of 30%-35%, and in our view, the revenue type that can drive most gross margin expansion is advertising revenue. The firm may prosper from either a rise in freemium users and, in turn, the number of advertisements shown, or from average revenue per user, by selling more ad inventory per user and/or extracting higher ad prices.

Through Okta's APIs, customers can develop tailored solutions that meld Okta's identity platform with a customer's web, cloud, and mobile applications for their end users. The expectation that customers can securely and easily log into the demanded resources are a critical component of business in the digital age, and we believe changing security vendors from a trusted existing provider would be challenging and could be a very costly decision.

We believe that these efforts, while costly, were critical to Yum China's expansion, allowing for greater menu flexibility and variability. Despite two well-publicized supplier-related incidents in China at the end of 2012 (where China's state television station CCTV reported that certain poultry suppliers in the eastern Shandong province had fed chickens excess amounts of antiviral drugs and hormones) and in mid-2014 (where Shanghai Husi Food--a subsidiary of US-based OSI Group--was accused of selling expired products to restaurant companies), we believe Yum China's supply chain and distribution network are unrivaled among restaurant operators in the region and act as a cost advantage moat source underpinning our wide moat rating. Yum China's products are largely sourced locally (save for certain herbs and spices), which we believe helps to keep costs manageable and positions KFC and Pizza Hut as more \"authentic\" Chinese brands (despite their obvious Western roots) while strengthening the company's relationships with national and regional government officials.

Long-term automotive segment dynamics are attractive, with average US vehicle age rising to 11.9 years in 2020 versus 10.6 years in 2010. However, the sector is sensitive to weather and fuel prices (in addition to unemployment). In a stronger economy, increased sales of new (under-warranty) cars and trucks could lead scrappage rates higher, reducing demand as older vehicles are replaced with more reliable alternatives that will not need significant aftermarket components for years. The industrial segment is exposed to the state of the US industrial economy.

{"context": "One can find multiple explanations for the divergence in fragmentation between developed and developing markets, but we posit that one of the reasons is the innately more complicated nature of distribution in less developed regions, which makes it more difficult for smaller players to economically operate throughout a full economic cycle. Most commercial beverages in these markets are still sold through smaller, mom and pop outlets referred to as the \"traditional trade.\" These retailers have a less reliable order pace and stock-keeping-unit assortments, which decreases the efficiency of the sales function. Moreover, many of the territories in these regions are far-flung and mountainous with low population density. These realities make operations in these markets more onerous, which we believe contributes to the higher levels of concentration and ongoing consolidation. In our view, the firm's leading volumes allow it to reduce fixed costs per unit through operating leverage, and variable costs per unit through more favorable raw material procurement terms.

{"context": "Reliance's niche in metal processing and inventory management exists largely because many smaller end users of processed metal products don't have the necessary scale to invest in capital-intensive metal processing equipment and because their order quantities often fall below the minimum threshold required by steel mills and other metal producers. Additionally, many of Reliance's customers require intermittent deliveries over irregular periods; as such, they can more effectively outsource their inventory-management needs to Reliance to reduce their own production costs, working capital needs, and capital expenditures. In aggregating processed metal demand across its base of over 125,000 customers, Reliance is able to secure sufficient throughput to justify the purchase of specialized equipment and technology that allow the company to manufacture over 100,000 product types. In our view, the most appropriate lens through which to analyze the company's moat is our industrial distribution moat framework. Reliance's value lies in the fact that it serves as a one-stop shop from which its customers can purchase a wide variety of processed metal products and receive delivery within 24 hours.

This works for customers because PMAs destroy resale value, so airlines tend to seek to maintain resale value on younger aircraft by shopping with OEMs when the resale value is more important and switching to PMAs when maintenance costs become more important on older aircraft. OEMs, with some exceptions, such as TransDigm, will also occasionally license out the right to create a part to a third-party manufacturer to avoid low-production inefficiencies for supporting every component.

Consumer lending is increasingly data driven as large proprietary data sets are needed to build the kinds of credit models necessary to make fast and effective underwriting decisions. As rapid credit decisions become the norm, access to large data sets and the ability to analyze them are increasingly a requirement to compete in consumer lending.

Larger industrial distributors can leverage their purchasing scale to globally source products and take advantage of volume-based rebates and other sales incentives that result in better gross profit margins relative to smaller distributors. Larger industrial distributors also operate scalable distribution networks and centralized order-fulfillment centers, which allows these companies to cost-effectively serve their customer base, including large customers that require consistent product availability and service quality across North America.

Given this industry dynamic, where yields on towers are typically in the mid-single digits with the first tenant, a competitor would need to average close to two tenants per tower before expecting to generate economic profits. However, Crown Castle states that it has historically taken about 10 years to add a tenant per tower. Consequently, even before considering other hurdles an upstart competitor would have to overcome to compete on Crown Castle's turf, it would have to contemplate sinking tremendous amounts of capital into building towers, locking itself into $1,000 per month land lease payments over a term of five to 10 years, and, especially given a likely need to offer lower average prices to carriers to entice them to switch, would likely be looking at a 10-year time frame before becoming economically profitable.

Currently, the bulk of consumer sales (about 55% of sales) is for maintenance projects, as new-home construction (pro sales, which represent around 45% of the total) can result in choppy quarter-to-quarter results, particularly in periods of economic uncertainty. Although new competitors could set up shop on Home Depot's turf, we think a new player in the industry would be hard-pressed to offer similar product prices, as it likely wouldn't have vendor relationships of the same strength. Ultimately, the biggest brands in home retailing will still want the biggest partners for distribution, leaving a new peer in a precarious position when it comes to acquiring enough of the most sought-out products to satisfy demand. Some risk still lies in competition from the e-commerce channel, particularly in categories that have been commodified.

Third, we'd characterize the incremental fee opportunities from refined product storage terminals and butane blending as low risk and attractive, given the lack of volatility in Magellan's end markets.

While these attributes have provided Cohen & Steers with a slightly higher degree of asset stickiness in stable and rising markets than most of the other asset managers in our coverage universe, the concentration risk that continues to exist in its investment portfolio ultimately inhibit the firm from building more than a narrow economic moat. Business ethics, product governance and data privacy and security are some of the larger issues for asset managers when looking at environmental, social, and governance risks. Cohen & Steers, in our view, is at a lower risk of experiencing material financial impacts from ESG factors, due to its medium exposure to risks that are inherent to the industry, as well as its own operations, offset by the firm's strong management of its material ESG issues (with the company having experienced only a moderate level of controversies over the years). From a business ethics and product governance perspective, failure to provide reliable and trustworthy services can impact both reputation and financial performance, so asset managers like Cohen & Steers tend to be more careful with how they manage the pricing, performance and positioning of their products.

Longer term, the positive mix impact of premiumization, together with modest operating leverage from volume growth in developing markets, should mean that a steady-state EBIT margin of over 32% is achievable.

While the patent protection of 510(k) and de novo clearance can be less comprehensive than alternatives such as premarket notification, which require human trials, time to market is shortened, and this strategy allows Teleflex to keep research and development costs lower than peers. Teleflex growth and profit outlook is strong, in our opinion, with UroLift-led growth likely to keep the firm's growth in the mid- to upper-single-digit range over the next few years, and restructuring and transformation efforts should improve the firm's margin profile, which has generally trailed peers. The core business, including anesthesia, surgical, and vascular access, is likely to maintain mid-single-digit growth over a longer-term period, in our view, with demand for hospital devices unlikely to face material headwinds.

In particular, buyers of analog semis typically don't demand smaller chips packed with more transistors, but rather, reliable products that deliver the desired accuracy and precision in power management or signal processing.

It was further driven to reduce initial 2019 guidance in response to the equity markets' downtick at the end of 2018, and rescinded preliminary 2020 comments as a result of COVID-19. In tandem with equity market volatility at the end of 2018, RH experienced a sales decline of around 10% in the final weeks of December, which persisted into the market rebound in January 2019, postponing sales.

To begin, efficient scale is witnessed by Sabre, Amadeus, and Travelport controlling around 95% of the market. The efficient scale advantage is also evident by Sabre's travel network scale, allowing it to offer global distribution to airlines at costs that are typically only a low-single-digit percentage of the total airline ticket (similar to expenses incurred for airlines through their own direct website bookings), which we believe would be timely and costly to replicate and improve upon, and which is buoyed by the fact that large online operating companies like Booking and Expedia continue to source airline content from Sabre and its peers versus building it out. While Sabre's distribution network holds network and efficient scale advantages, its IT solutions and hospitality solutions business (27% of 2019 revenue after eliminations), provide a third switching cost advantage, which makes it costly and time consuming for carriers to move to another provider. This is illustrated by IT solution contract lengths of three to seven years, implementation times of one to two years with high costs, and renewal rates for Sabre that are comfortably above 90% (peer Amadeus has noted similar renewal rates).

While these are not colossal increases, we think they illustrate a dynamic that patently favors TCCC. Also, more generally, there is an inherent pricing disadvantage to operating at the distribution portion of the supply chain. Price increases are easier to implement as a concentrate producer, due to the exponentially lower price points at which it sells and the lower proportion of total bottler cost of goods sold that the beverage base constitutes. For example, a Harvard Business School case study written by David Yoffie and Renee Kim in 2012 estimates that a unit case of concentrate sells for $0.98, while a typical bottler will buy that concentrate, add an additional $1.69 worth of inputs (for total COGS of $2.67), and sell that equivalent unit case of finished beverages to a retailer for $4.63. If the concentrate producer wants to take a 10% price increase, all else equal, this would result in a 3.7% COGS increase for the bottler and, if the bottler passes it through to maintain its margin, a 2.1% price increase for the retailer.", "question": "Why Price increases are easier to implement as a concentrate producer?", "lab": "the exponentially lower price points at which it sells and the lower proportion of total bottler cost of goods sold that the beverage base constitutes"}

In addition to process development challenges (including aggressive scaling targets and new interconnect materials), the secular PC decline and relative lack of competition from AMD all contributed to Intel delaying its 10-nm process ramp, in our opinion. With both TSMC and Samsung reaching their respective 7-nm process nodes (which we generally equate to Intel's 10-nm regarding transistor density and performance), AMD (via TSMC) launched newer products at a smaller process node in 2019.

K3 will not require the additional brine inflow expense, which averaged 10%-15% of cost of goods sold before the ramp-up of K3, which will provide Mosaic with more attractive unit costs.", "question": "Why K3 will not require the additional brine inflow expense?", "lab": "averaged 10%-15% of cost of goods sold before the ramp-up of K3"}
{"context": "Along those lines, low visibility surrounding the magnitude of industrial end market recovery brings uncertainty to our volume assumptions for 2021 and 2022. A key driver of improvement is easing government restrictions as the pandemic dissipates. Additionally, given the northern location of CN's assets, adverse winter weather can materially hamper efficiency by blocking tracks and necessitating shorter trains throughout certain times of the year. CN has exchange-rate risk, but relatively low coal exposure (indeed, the lowest proportional exposure among large railroads) mitigates volume lost to cheap natural gas as a power generation fuel source. Fuel price shocks are mostly mitigated via fuel surcharges.", "question": "What will happen if low visibility surrounding the magnitude of industrial end market recovery?", "lab": "uncertainty to our volume assumptions for 2021 and 2022"}
