Hooded youths hurled petrol bombs at stores and businesses in the center of the capital Athens and demonstrators tried to storm parliament during the general strike , as the rioting spread to the northern city of Thessaloniki . Police said two women and one man died at a branch of the Marfin bank which caught fire after rioters broke a window and threw Molotov cocktails inside . Around 20 more people had to be ushered to safety . \"Nobody has the right to violence and particularly violence that leads to murder , \" Prime Minister George Papandreou told parliament as he condemned \"a raw murderous act\" . At least two other buildings , one used by tax officials , caught fire in other fire - bomb attacks on the margins of the protests . Athens underground stations were shuttered and the international airport deserted as tens of thousands of union members rallied on the eve of a vote in parliament on the planned cuts and tax hikes . The general strike was the first major test of the Socialist government's resolve to push through unprecedented measures since agreeing a ? 110 - billion ( $143 - billion ) EU and IMF debt bailout at the weekend . Papandreou's insistence that the measures are vital for the nation's survival failed to dissuade unions from paralyzing public services . After rallying in two separate demonstrations in central Athens , unionists marched on parliament where a vote on the measures will be held Thursday . \"They're taking everything from me , I don't know how I'm going to get by , \" said 61 - year - old Anargyros Bizianis , a municipal worker in the Athens suburb of Piraeus who earns ? 900 a month . As the protestors tried to break through a police line in front of parliament , they first hurled stones and bottles of water , prompting officers to respond with tear gas . Full - scale clashes then erupted , with riot police trying to disperse the crowds with baton - charges . During the unrest , one protestor threw a petrol bomb . Youths also went on the rampage in other parts of the capital , with several dozen youths hurling petrol bombs at stores , smashing shop windows and bus shelters with iron bars . Athens police chiefs mobilized all their forces , including those not on active duty , by declaring a general state of alert . The protestors in Thessaloniki targeted stores and banks in the city center before they were dispersed by the anti - riot police . A group of about 200 communists had stormed the Athens Acropolis on Tuesday , unfurling banners reading \"Peoples of Europe , Rise Up . \" \"The Greek people have been called to make sacrifices while the rich pay nothing , \" said Giannis Panagopoulos , head of the GSEE private sector union . A government official downplayed the unrest saying that \"for years there's been strikes and protests in this country without much consequence . \" But markets reacted with alarm as Greek stocks closed down 3 . 9 percent . Pushed to the brink of default , the government agreed at the weekend to slash spending and jack up taxes in return for 110 billion euros in loans over three years from eurozone countries and the International Monetary Fund . Among the major measures , the government is to cut 13th and 14th month bonus pay for civil servants and retirees ; require three years more for pension contributions ; and raise the retirement age for women to 65 . After months of hesitation , eurozone countries and the IMF agreed to lend Greece billions at below market rates after concerns the Athens crisis could trigger a knock - on effect elsewhere . Fighting accusations of holding up the bailout , German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the crisis underlined the need for an overhaul of EU fiscal rules . \"The future of Europe and the future of Germany within Europe is at stake , \" she told a debate on Berlin's decision to lend ? 22 . 4 billion to Greece .", "e0": "attack", "e1": "caught", "e0_pos": [252, 258], "e1_pos": [750, 756], "lab": "EFFECT"}

The scenes of violence on blocks near the NYPD \u2019 s 67th Precinct stationhouse followed a protest march that grew out of a candlelight vigil for Kimani ( Kiki ) Gray , 16 , killed by police bullets on Saturday . In the aftermath of the riot , as police were trying to secure the area and assess damage to stores along streets strewn with broken glass , City Councilman Jumaane Williams called for Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly and Mayor Bloomberg to visit the community . \u201c There \u2019 s a lot of anger here , \u201d said Williams , whose district includes the riot zone . \u201c This isn \u2019 t just from one particular shooting .

In the aftermath of the riot , as police were trying to secure the area and assess damage to stores along streets strewn with broken glass , City Councilman Jumaane Williams called for Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly and Mayor Bloomberg to visit the community . \u201c There \u2019 s a lot of anger here , \u201d said Williams , whose district includes the riot zone . \u201c This isn \u2019 t just from one particular shooting . A whole community has not been heard for far too long . \u201d Kelly visited the precinct stationhouse about 12 : 30 a . m . Tuesday \u2014 more than four hours after the chaos began \u2014 but did not speak to reporters . The vigil for Kimani was held at E . 52nd St . and Tilden Ave . , the location of the shooting , which has caused tensions to simmer in the community , in part because the boy \u2019 s family contests police allegations that he was armed with a handgun . Starting at about 8 p . m . , nearly 100 people set off from the vigil site to march the more than 20 blocks to the precinct stationhouse , on Snyder Ave . near Nostrand Ave . But the procession , peaceful at first , turned into a wild confrontation between furious marchers and cops after a faction broke off from the group and began to smash car and store windows with rocks and jump on the tops of vehicles , police sources and witnesses said . \u201c I was sitting in my living room , \u201d said Mary John , 43 , who witnessed destruction near E . 31st St . and Church Ave . \u201c People were standing up on vehicles . I saw them take garbage from the sidewalk and throw it onto the street . I saw someone take a TV and smash it into my neighbor \u2019 s car . They were throwing rocks at the cars . \u201c I said , \u2018 Oh my god ! What \u2019 s going on here ? \u2019 \u201d she continued . \u201c They were calling out , \u2018 Rest in peace , Kiki . \u2019 I was shocked . \u201d Abdoulaye Barry , 24 , who works at African Movies , at Church Ave . and E . 31st St . , described how rioters tried to storm the business . He said he was outside , saw rioters causing mayhem in the streets , and rushed back to urge his co - workers to lock the store \u2019 s gates . Rioters rushed the entrance , fighting with workers as they struggled to lock the roll - down gates , he said . The workers succeeded \u2014 barely . But they locked themselves into the store from the inside . Firefighters later had to cut the gates to liberate them . \u201c It was like the end of the world , \u201d Barry told the Daily News . \u201c That \u2019 s the first time something like that had happened here . \u201d At a Rite Aid drug store on Church Ave . near Albany Ave . , which had about 60 people inside at the time , at least one rioter physically assaulted a customer \u2014 cracking him over the head with a glass bottle . He was rushed to Kings County Hospital and listed in stable condition later , a police spokeswoman said . A manager of the store was also assaulted ; he refused medical attention , the spokeswoman said . There were unconfirmed reports the store was looted ; the police spokeswoman said only that the cash registers were not robbed . When cops finally managed to block the mob \u2019 s progress , about a block from the 67th Precinct stationhouse , rioters began pitching glass bottles at police officers as they moved in on the crowd , a police source said . One person threw a garbage can at a cop , the source added . \u201c They \u2019 re acting rowdy and calling us racist , \u201d said a police officer at the scene . As rioters fled into the night and protestors began making their way back toward E . 52nd St . , Williams joined the fray and tried to prevent more violence . \u201c The mayor and the [ police ] commissioner should be down here . Right now ! \u201d Williams , a critic of NYPD policy , said before Kelly appeared on the scene . \u201c There \u2019 s a feeling that they don \u2019 t really care . They are leading and policing for one portion of this city . But they \u2019 re not paying attention to the other parts ; they \u2019 re not listening to them . \u201d Public Advocate Bill de Blasio , a Democratic candidate for mayor this year , also came to the area Monday night . \u201c I understand if young people are frustrated , but we have to help them understand the way to deal with it should be a peaceful way , \u201d he said . \u201c They have every right to protest \u2014 that \u2019 s the American way . \u201d Williams said he was not surprised by the riot , only that it hadn \u2019 t happened before . Critics of the NYPD \u2019 s controversial stop - and - frisk policy argued it leads to distrust of the police by the black community because its members are stopped in such high numbers . \u201c When something happens , we should be able to trust the police and what they say , \u201d Williams said . \u201c Police officers shooting black men , black men shooting black men , it \u2019 s a problem that needs to be dealt with .

In the aftermath of the riot , as police were trying to secure the area and assess damage to stores along streets strewn with broken glass , City Councilman Jumaane Williams called for Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly and Mayor Bloomberg to visit the community . \u201c There \u2019 s a lot of anger here , \u201d said Williams , whose district includes the riot zone . \u201c This isn \u2019 t just from one particular shooting .

Tuesday \u2014 more than four hours after the chaos began \u2014 but did not speak to reporters . The vigil for Kimani was held at E . 52nd St . and Tilden Ave . , the location of the shooting , which has caused tensions to simmer in the community , in part because the boy \u2019 s family contests police allegations that he was armed with a handgun . Starting at about 8 p . m . , nearly 100 people set off from the vigil site to march the more than 20 blocks to the precinct stationhouse , on Snyder Ave . near Nostrand Ave . But the procession , peaceful at first , turned into a wild confrontation between furious marchers and cops after a faction broke off from the group and began to smash car and store windows with rocks and jump on the tops of vehicles , police sources and witnesses said . \u201c I was sitting in my living room , \u201d said Mary John , 43 , who witnessed destruction near E . 31st St . and Church Ave . \u201c People were standing up on vehicles . I saw them take garbage from the sidewalk and throw it onto the street . I saw someone take a TV and smash it into my neighbor \u2019 s car .

What \u2019 s going on here ? \u2019 \u201d she continued . \u201c They were calling out , \u2018 Rest in peace , Kiki . \u2019 I was shocked . \u201d Abdoulaye Barry , 24 , who works at African Movies , at Church Ave . and E . 31st St . , described how rioters tried to storm the business . He said he was outside , saw rioters causing mayhem in the streets , and rushed back to urge his co - workers to lock the store \u2019 s gates . Rioters rushed the entrance , fighting with workers as they struggled to lock the roll - down gates , he said . The workers succeeded \u2014 barely . But they locked themselves into the store from the inside . Firefighters later had to cut the gates to liberate them . \u201c It was like the end of the world , \u201d Barry told the Daily News . \u201c That \u2019 s the first time something like that had happened here . \u201d At a Rite Aid drug store on Church Ave . near Albany Ave . , which had about 60 people inside at the time , at least one rioter physically assaulted a customer \u2014 cracking him over the head with a glass bottle . He was rushed to Kings County Hospital and listed in stable condition later , a police spokeswoman said . A manager of the store was also assaulted ; he refused medical attention , the spokeswoman said . There were unconfirmed reports the store was looted ; the police spokeswoman said only that the cash registers were not robbed . When cops finally managed to block the mob \u2019 s progress , about a block from the 67th Precinct stationhouse , rioters began pitching glass bottles at police officers as they moved in on the crowd , a police source said . One person threw a garbage can at a cop , the source added . \u201c They \u2019 re acting rowdy and calling us racist , \u201d said a police officer at the scene .

In the aftermath of the riot , as police were trying to secure the area and assess damage to stores along streets strewn with broken glass , City Councilman Jumaane Williams called for Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly and Mayor Bloomberg to visit the community . \u201c There \u2019 s a lot of anger here , \u201d said Williams , whose district includes the riot zone . \u201c This isn \u2019 t just from one particular shooting .

Tuesday \u2014 more than four hours after the chaos began \u2014 but did not speak to reporters . The vigil for Kimani was held at E . 52nd St . and Tilden Ave . , the location of the shooting , which has caused tensions to simmer in the community , in part because the boy \u2019 s family contests police allegations that he was armed with a handgun . Starting at about 8 p . m . , nearly 100 people set off from the vigil site to march the more than 20 blocks to the precinct stationhouse , on Snyder Ave . near Nostrand Ave . But the procession , peaceful at first , turned into a wild confrontation between furious marchers and cops after a faction broke off from the group and began to smash car and store windows with rocks and jump on the tops of vehicles , police sources and witnesses said . \u201c I was sitting in my living room , \u201d said Mary John , 43 , who witnessed destruction near E . 31st St . and Church Ave . \u201c People were standing up on vehicles . I saw them take garbage from the sidewalk and throw it onto the street . I saw someone take a TV and smash it into my neighbor \u2019 s car .

What \u2019 s going on here ? \u2019 \u201d she continued . \u201c They were calling out , \u2018 Rest in peace , Kiki . \u2019 I was shocked . \u201d Abdoulaye Barry , 24 , who works at African Movies , at Church Ave . and E . 31st St . , described how rioters tried to storm the business . He said he was outside , saw rioters causing mayhem in the streets , and rushed back to urge his co - workers to lock the store \u2019 s gates . Rioters rushed the entrance , fighting with workers as they struggled to lock the roll - down gates , he said . The workers succeeded \u2014 barely . But they locked themselves into the store from the inside . Firefighters later had to cut the gates to liberate them . \u201c It was like the end of the world , \u201d Barry told the Daily News . \u201c That \u2019 s the first time something like that had happened here . \u201d At a Rite Aid drug store on Church Ave . near Albany Ave . , which had about 60 people inside at the time , at least one rioter physically assaulted a customer \u2014 cracking him over the head with a glass bottle . He was rushed to Kings County Hospital and listed in stable condition later , a police spokeswoman said . A manager of the store was also assaulted ; he refused medical attention , the spokeswoman said . There were unconfirmed reports the store was looted ; the police spokeswoman said only that the cash registers were not robbed . When cops finally managed to block the mob \u2019 s progress , about a block from the 67th Precinct stationhouse , rioters began pitching glass bottles at police officers as they moved in on the crowd , a police source said . One person threw a garbage can at a cop , the source added . \u201c They \u2019 re acting rowdy and calling us racist , \u201d said a police officer at the scene .

PUBLISHED : MONDAY , MARCH 11 , 2013 , 10 : 34 PM UPDATED : TUESDAY , MARCH 12 , 2013 , 9 : 36 AM Anger over the death of a Brooklyn teenager shot and killed by police fueled a riot on the streets of East Flatbush Monday \u2014 projectiles were hurled at cops , car windows were smashed and a pharmacy customer had a bottle bashed over his head . The scenes of violence on blocks near the NYPD \u2019 s 67th Precinct stationhouse followed a protest march that grew out of a candlelight vigil for Kimani ( Kiki ) Gray , 16 , killed by police bullets on Saturday . In the aftermath of the riot , as police were trying to secure the area and assess damage to stores along streets strewn with broken glass , City Councilman Jumaane Williams called for Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly and Mayor Bloomberg to visit the community . \u201c There \u2019 s a lot of anger here , \u201d said Williams , whose district includes the riot zone . \u201c This isn \u2019 t just from one particular shooting .

Tuesday \u2014 more than four hours after the chaos began \u2014 but did not speak to reporters .

{"doc": "http : / / www . foxnews . com / world / 2010 / 05 / 05 / brigade - says - person - dead - bank - riots - demonstration / Greek Prime Minister Calls Bank Workers' Riot Deaths 'Murder' Published May 05 , 2010 The Greek prime minister has denounced what he called the \"murder\" of three bank workers killed when the building they were in was torched during protests in Athens against harsh new austerity measures . Prime Minister George Papandreou vowed Wednesday that those responsible for the deaths would be found and brought to justice . He told Parliament that \"a demonstration is one thing and murder is quite another . \" The two women and a man were killed during demonstrations by tens of thousands who marched through Athens . The national strike was held to protest the austerity measures announced last weekend so that Greece can get a $144 billion bailout from the International Monetary fund and other European nations . Three people died when an Athens bank went up in flames Wednesday as tens of thousands of Greeks took to the streets to protest harsh spending cuts aimed at saving the country from bankruptcy . The fire brigade said the bodies were found in the wreckage of a Marfin Bank branch , on the route of the march in the city center . Demonstrators chanting \"thieves , thieves\" attempted to break through a riot police cordon guarding Parliament and chased the ceremonial guards away from the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in front of the building . An estimated 100 , 000 people took to the streets as part of nationwide strikes to protest austerity measures imposed as a condition of bailout loans from the International Monetary Fund and other eurozone governments . The bailout is needed to keep heavily indebted Greece from defaulting on its debts . The loans are aimed at preventing Athens' debt troubles from becoming a wider crisis for the Euro by engulfing other financially troubled countries such as Spain and Portugal . But the rioting underlined skepticism that the Greek government could keep up its end of the bargain , helping drive the Euro below $1 . 29 for the first time in over a year . Union reaction until now had been relatively muted by Greece's volatile standards , although the country has been hit by a series of strikes . But anger has mounted after the announcement of new austerity measures , which were essential to unlock the loans . Papandreou on Sunday announced cuts in salaries and pensions for civil servants , and another round of consumer tax increases , as a condition of the bailout . In Germany , Chancellor Angela Merkel urged parliament to quickly pass the country's share of the bailout - - 22 billion Euros over three years . The goal is passage by Friday ; Greece faces a May 19 due date on debt it says it can't repay without the bailout . \"Nothing less than the future of Europe , and with that the future of Germany in Europe , is at stake , \" Merkel told lawmakers . \"We are at a fork in the road . \" Extensive clashes took place a broad swathe of central Athens , with hundreds of people battering store fronts and smashing paving stones to throw at the police , who responded with stun grenades and volleys of tear gas that left clouds of smoke hovering over the streets . Violence also broke out in the northern city of Thessaloniki , where another 20 , 000 people marched through the city center , with youths smashing windows of stores and fast food restaurants . The outpouring of anger appeared much more spontaneous than the frequent set piece battles between police and anarchist youths who often spark violence during Greek demonstrations . The marches came amid a 24 - hour nationwide general strike that grounded all flights to and from Greece , shut down ports , schools and government services and left hospitals working with emergency medical staff . The Acropolis and all other ancient sites were closed , while journalists also walked off the job , suspending television and radio news broadcasts . Some media - - including state television and the Ta Nea newspaper Web site - - broke the strike to report on the deaths . Greek unions concede that the cash - strapped government was forced to increase consumer taxes and slash spending , including cutting salaries and pensions for civil servants . But they say low - income Greeks will suffer disproportionately from the measures , which aim to save $40 billion - - the country's current budget deficit - - through 2012 . \"These people are losing their rights , they are losing their future , \" said Yiannis Panagopoulos , head of GSEE , one of the two largest union organizations . \"The country cannot surrender without a fight . \" IMF head Dominique Strauss - Kahn warned that the crisis could spread to other countries despite the rescue package's efforts to contain it . \"Everyone must remain extremely vigilant , \" to this risk , Strauss - Kahn said in an interview published in French newspaper Le Parisien Wednesday . \"I completely understand the Greek populations' anger , its incomprehension at the size of the economic catastrophe , \" Strauss - Kahn said . But Greeks must also understand that without these measures , \"the situation would be infinitely more serious , \" he said . Those who are feeling the crunch are outraged that they have to pay for what they see as politicians' mismanagement of their country's economy . \"We'll be on the streets every day , every day ! You never win unless you fight , \" said 76 - year - old Constantinos Doganis , who gets euro345 a month from his farming pension fund . \"It's our fault too , all the mistakes made by politicians over 30 years , all the people who cheat on their taxes , \" he said . \"But they are behaving like buzzards - - the Germans borrow money at 3 percent and then lend it to us for 5 . Why ? \" Despite the strike , the draft bill of the new austerity measures is to be voted on Thursday . Prime Minister George Papandreou's Socialists hold a comfortable majority of 160 in the 300 - seat Parliament , and with a simple majority of 151 votes needed , the bill is expected to be passed easily .", "e0": "killed", "e1": "went up in", "e0_pos": [654, 660], "e1_pos": [969, 979], "lab": "CAUSE"}

Prime Minister George Papandreou vowed Wednesday that those responsible for the deaths would be found and brought to justice . He told Parliament that \"a demonstration is one thing and murder is quite another . \" The two women and a man were killed during demonstrations by tens of thousands who marched through Athens . The national strike was held to protest the austerity measures announced last weekend so that Greece can get a $144 billion bailout from the International Monetary fund and other European nations . Three people died when an Athens bank went up in flames Wednesday as tens of thousands of Greeks took to the streets to protest harsh spending cuts aimed at saving the country from bankruptcy . The fire brigade said the bodies were found in the wreckage of a Marfin Bank branch , on the route of the march in the city center . Demonstrators chanting \"thieves , thieves\" attempted to break through a riot police cordon guarding Parliament and chased the ceremonial guards away from the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in front of the building . An estimated 100 , 000 people took to the streets as part of nationwide strikes to protest austerity measures imposed as a condition of bailout loans from the International Monetary Fund and other eurozone governments . The bailout is needed to keep heavily indebted Greece from defaulting on its debts . The loans are aimed at preventing Athens' debt troubles from becoming a wider crisis for the Euro by engulfing other financially troubled countries such as Spain and Portugal . But the rioting underlined skepticism that the Greek government could keep up its end of the bargain , helping drive the Euro below $1 . 29 for the first time in over a year . Union reaction until now had been relatively muted by Greece's volatile standards , although the country has been hit by a series of strikes . But anger has mounted after the announcement of new austerity measures , which were essential to unlock the loans . Papandreou on Sunday announced cuts in salaries and pensions for civil servants , and another round of consumer tax increases , as a condition of the bailout . In Germany , Chancellor Angela Merkel urged parliament to quickly pass the country's share of the bailout - - 22 billion Euros over three years . The goal is passage by Friday ; Greece faces a May 19 due date on debt it says it can't repay without the bailout . \"Nothing less than the future of Europe , and with that the future of Germany in Europe , is at stake , \" Merkel told lawmakers . \"We are at a fork in the road . \" Extensive clashes took place a broad swathe of central Athens , with hundreds of people battering store fronts and smashing paving stones to throw at the police , who responded with stun grenades and volleys of tear gas that left clouds of smoke hovering over the streets . Violence also broke out in the northern city of Thessaloniki , where another 20 , 000 people marched through the city center , with youths smashing windows of stores and fast food restaurants . The outpouring of anger appeared much more spontaneous than the frequent set piece battles between police and anarchist youths who often spark violence during Greek demonstrations . The marches came amid a 24 - hour nationwide general strike that grounded all flights to and from Greece , shut down ports , schools and government services and left hospitals working with emergency medical staff . The Acropolis and all other ancient sites were closed , while journalists also walked off the job , suspending television and radio news broadcasts .

Prime Minister George Papandreou vowed Wednesday that those responsible for the deaths would be found and brought to justice . He told Parliament that \"a demonstration is one thing and murder is quite another . \" The two women and a man were killed during demonstrations by tens of thousands who marched through Athens . The national strike was held to protest the austerity measures announced last weekend so that Greece can get a $144 billion bailout from the International Monetary fund and other European nations . Three people died when an Athens bank went up in flames Wednesday as tens of thousands of Greeks took to the streets to protest harsh spending cuts aimed at saving the country from bankruptcy . The fire brigade said the bodies were found in the wreckage of a Marfin Bank branch , on the route of the march in the city center . Demonstrators chanting \"thieves , thieves\" attempted to break through a riot police cordon guarding Parliament and chased the ceremonial guards away from the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in front of the building . An estimated 100 , 000 people took to the streets as part of nationwide strikes to protest austerity measures imposed as a condition of bailout loans from the International Monetary Fund and other eurozone governments . The bailout is needed to keep heavily indebted Greece from defaulting on its debts . The loans are aimed at preventing Athens' debt troubles from becoming a wider crisis for the Euro by engulfing other financially troubled countries such as Spain and Portugal . But the rioting underlined skepticism that the Greek government could keep up its end of the bargain , helping drive the Euro below $1 . 29 for the first time in over a year . Union reaction until now had been relatively muted by Greece's volatile standards , although the country has been hit by a series of strikes . But anger has mounted after the announcement of new austerity measures , which were essential to unlock the loans . Papandreou on Sunday announced cuts in salaries and pensions for civil servants , and another round of consumer tax increases , as a condition of the bailout . In Germany , Chancellor Angela Merkel urged parliament to quickly pass the country's share of the bailout - - 22 billion Euros over three years . The goal is passage by Friday ; Greece faces a May 19 due date on debt it says it can't repay without the bailout . \"Nothing less than the future of Europe , and with that the future of Germany in Europe , is at stake , \" Merkel told lawmakers . \"We are at a fork in the road . \" Extensive clashes took place a broad swathe of central Athens , with hundreds of people battering store fronts and smashing paving stones to throw at the police , who responded with stun grenades and volleys of tear gas that left clouds of smoke hovering over the streets . Violence also broke out in the northern city of Thessaloniki , where another 20 , 000 people marched through the city center , with youths smashing windows of stores and fast food restaurants . The outpouring of anger appeared much more spontaneous than the frequent set piece battles between police and anarchist youths who often spark violence during Greek demonstrations . The marches came amid a 24 - hour nationwide general strike that grounded all flights to and from Greece , shut down ports , schools and government services and left hospitals working with emergency medical staff . The Acropolis and all other ancient sites were closed , while journalists also walked off the job , suspending television and radio news broadcasts .

Prime Minister George Papandreou vowed Wednesday that those responsible for the deaths would be found and brought to justice . He told Parliament that \"a demonstration is one thing and murder is quite another . \" The two women and a man were killed during demonstrations by tens of thousands who marched through Athens . The national strike was held to protest the austerity measures announced last weekend so that Greece can get a $144 billion bailout from the International Monetary fund and other European nations . Three people died when an Athens bank went up in flames Wednesday as tens of thousands of Greeks took to the streets to protest harsh spending cuts aimed at saving the country from bankruptcy . The fire brigade said the bodies were found in the wreckage of a Marfin Bank branch , on the route of the march in the city center . Demonstrators chanting \"thieves , thieves\" attempted to break through a riot police cordon guarding Parliament and chased the ceremonial guards away from the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in front of the building . An estimated 100 , 000 people took to the streets as part of nationwide strikes to protest austerity measures imposed as a condition of bailout loans from the International Monetary Fund and other eurozone governments . The bailout is needed to keep heavily indebted Greece from defaulting on its debts . The loans are aimed at preventing Athens' debt troubles from becoming a wider crisis for the Euro by engulfing other financially troubled countries such as Spain and Portugal . But the rioting underlined skepticism that the Greek government could keep up its end of the bargain , helping drive the Euro below $1 . 29 for the first time in over a year . Union reaction until now had been relatively muted by Greece's volatile standards , although the country has been hit by a series of strikes . But anger has mounted after the announcement of new austerity measures , which were essential to unlock the loans . Papandreou on Sunday announced cuts in salaries and pensions for civil servants , and another round of consumer tax increases , as a condition of the bailout . In Germany , Chancellor Angela Merkel urged parliament to quickly pass the country's share of the bailout - - 22 billion Euros over three years . The goal is passage by Friday ; Greece faces a May 19 due date on debt it says it can't repay without the bailout . \"Nothing less than the future of Europe , and with that the future of Germany in Europe , is at stake , \" Merkel told lawmakers . \"We are at a fork in the road . \" Extensive clashes took place a broad swathe of central Athens , with hundreds of people battering store fronts and smashing paving stones to throw at the police , who responded with stun grenades and volleys of tear gas that left clouds of smoke hovering over the streets . Violence also broke out in the northern city of Thessaloniki , where another 20 , 000 people marched through the city center , with youths smashing windows of stores and fast food restaurants . The outpouring of anger appeared much more spontaneous than the frequent set piece battles between police and anarchist youths who often spark violence during Greek demonstrations . The marches came amid a 24 - hour nationwide general strike that grounded all flights to and from Greece , shut down ports , schools and government services and left hospitals working with emergency medical staff . The Acropolis and all other ancient sites were closed , while journalists also walked off the job , suspending television and radio news broadcasts .

Prime Minister George Papandreou vowed Wednesday that those responsible for the deaths would be found and brought to justice . He told Parliament that \"a demonstration is one thing and murder is quite another . \" The two women and a man were killed during demonstrations by tens of thousands who marched through Athens . The national strike was held to protest the austerity measures announced last weekend so that Greece can get a $144 billion bailout from the International Monetary fund and other European nations . Three people died when an Athens bank went up in flames Wednesday as tens of thousands of Greeks took to the streets to protest harsh spending cuts aimed at saving the country from bankruptcy . The fire brigade said the bodies were found in the wreckage of a Marfin Bank branch , on the route of the march in the city center . Demonstrators chanting \"thieves , thieves\" attempted to break through a riot police cordon guarding Parliament and chased the ceremonial guards away from the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in front of the building . An estimated 100 , 000 people took to the streets as part of nationwide strikes to protest austerity measures imposed as a condition of bailout loans from the International Monetary Fund and other eurozone governments . The bailout is needed to keep heavily indebted Greece from defaulting on its debts . The loans are aimed at preventing Athens' debt troubles from becoming a wider crisis for the Euro by engulfing other financially troubled countries such as Spain and Portugal . But the rioting underlined skepticism that the Greek government could keep up its end of the bargain , helping drive the Euro below $1 . 29 for the first time in over a year . Union reaction until now had been relatively muted by Greece's volatile standards , although the country has been hit by a series of strikes . But anger has mounted after the announcement of new austerity measures , which were essential to unlock the loans . Papandreou on Sunday announced cuts in salaries and pensions for civil servants , and another round of consumer tax increases , as a condition of the bailout . In Germany , Chancellor Angela Merkel urged parliament to quickly pass the country's share of the bailout - - 22 billion Euros over three years . The goal is passage by Friday ; Greece faces a May 19 due date on debt it says it can't repay without the bailout . \"Nothing less than the future of Europe , and with that the future of Germany in Europe , is at stake , \" Merkel told lawmakers . \"We are at a fork in the road . \" Extensive clashes took place a broad swathe of central Athens , with hundreds of people battering store fronts and smashing paving stones to throw at the police , who responded with stun grenades and volleys of tear gas that left clouds of smoke hovering over the streets . Violence also broke out in the northern city of Thessaloniki , where another 20 , 000 people marched through the city center , with youths smashing windows of stores and fast food restaurants . The outpouring of anger appeared much more spontaneous than the frequent set piece battles between police and anarchist youths who often spark violence during Greek demonstrations . The marches came amid a 24 - hour nationwide general strike that grounded all flights to and from Greece , shut down ports , schools and government services and left hospitals working with emergency medical staff . The Acropolis and all other ancient sites were closed , while journalists also walked off the job , suspending television and radio news broadcasts .

Prime Minister George Papandreou vowed Wednesday that those responsible for the deaths would be found and brought to justice . He told Parliament that \"a demonstration is one thing and murder is quite another . \" The two women and a man were killed during demonstrations by tens of thousands who marched through Athens . The national strike was held to protest the austerity measures announced last weekend so that Greece can get a $144 billion bailout from the International Monetary fund and other European nations . Three people died when an Athens bank went up in flames Wednesday as tens of thousands of Greeks took to the streets to protest harsh spending cuts aimed at saving the country from bankruptcy . The fire brigade said the bodies were found in the wreckage of a Marfin Bank branch , on the route of the march in the city center . Demonstrators chanting \"thieves , thieves\" attempted to break through a riot police cordon guarding Parliament and chased the ceremonial guards away from the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in front of the building . An estimated 100 , 000 people took to the streets as part of nationwide strikes to protest austerity measures imposed as a condition of bailout loans from the International Monetary Fund and other eurozone governments . The bailout is needed to keep heavily indebted Greece from defaulting on its debts . The loans are aimed at preventing Athens' debt troubles from becoming a wider crisis for the Euro by engulfing other financially troubled countries such as Spain and Portugal . But the rioting underlined skepticism that the Greek government could keep up its end of the bargain , helping drive the Euro below $1 . 29 for the first time in over a year . Union reaction until now had been relatively muted by Greece's volatile standards , although the country has been hit by a series of strikes . But anger has mounted after the announcement of new austerity measures , which were essential to unlock the loans . Papandreou on Sunday announced cuts in salaries and pensions for civil servants , and another round of consumer tax increases , as a condition of the bailout . In Germany , Chancellor Angela Merkel urged parliament to quickly pass the country's share of the bailout - - 22 billion Euros over three years . The goal is passage by Friday ; Greece faces a May 19 due date on debt it says it can't repay without the bailout . \"Nothing less than the future of Europe , and with that the future of Germany in Europe , is at stake , \" Merkel told lawmakers . \"We are at a fork in the road . \" Extensive clashes took place a broad swathe of central Athens , with hundreds of people battering store fronts and smashing paving stones to throw at the police , who responded with stun grenades and volleys of tear gas that left clouds of smoke hovering over the streets . Violence also broke out in the northern city of Thessaloniki , where another 20 , 000 people marched through the city center , with youths smashing windows of stores and fast food restaurants . The outpouring of anger appeared much more spontaneous than the frequent set piece battles between police and anarchist youths who often spark violence during Greek demonstrations . The marches came amid a 24 - hour nationwide general strike that grounded all flights to and from Greece , shut down ports , schools and government services and left hospitals working with emergency medical staff . The Acropolis and all other ancient sites were closed , while journalists also walked off the job , suspending television and radio news broadcasts .

Prime Minister George Papandreou vowed Wednesday that those responsible for the deaths would be found and brought to justice . He told Parliament that \"a demonstration is one thing and murder is quite another . \" The two women and a man were killed during demonstrations by tens of thousands who marched through Athens . The national strike was held to protest the austerity measures announced last weekend so that Greece can get a $144 billion bailout from the International Monetary fund and other European nations . Three people died when an Athens bank went up in flames Wednesday as tens of thousands of Greeks took to the streets to protest harsh spending cuts aimed at saving the country from bankruptcy . The fire brigade said the bodies were found in the wreckage of a Marfin Bank branch , on the route of the march in the city center . Demonstrators chanting \"thieves , thieves\" attempted to break through a riot police cordon guarding Parliament and chased the ceremonial guards away from the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in front of the building . An estimated 100 , 000 people took to the streets as part of nationwide strikes to protest austerity measures imposed as a condition of bailout loans from the International Monetary Fund and other eurozone governments . The bailout is needed to keep heavily indebted Greece from defaulting on its debts . The loans are aimed at preventing Athens' debt troubles from becoming a wider crisis for the Euro by engulfing other financially troubled countries such as Spain and Portugal . But the rioting underlined skepticism that the Greek government could keep up its end of the bargain , helping drive the Euro below $1 . 29 for the first time in over a year . Union reaction until now had been relatively muted by Greece's volatile standards , although the country has been hit by a series of strikes . But anger has mounted after the announcement of new austerity measures , which were essential to unlock the loans . Papandreou on Sunday announced cuts in salaries and pensions for civil servants , and another round of consumer tax increases , as a condition of the bailout . In Germany , Chancellor Angela Merkel urged parliament to quickly pass the country's share of the bailout - - 22 billion Euros over three years . The goal is passage by Friday ; Greece faces a May 19 due date on debt it says it can't repay without the bailout . \"Nothing less than the future of Europe , and with that the future of Germany in Europe , is at stake , \" Merkel told lawmakers . \"We are at a fork in the road . \" Extensive clashes took place a broad swathe of central Athens , with hundreds of people battering store fronts and smashing paving stones to throw at the police , who responded with stun grenades and volleys of tear gas that left clouds of smoke hovering over the streets . Violence also broke out in the northern city of Thessaloniki , where another 20 , 000 people marched through the city center , with youths smashing windows of stores and fast food restaurants . The outpouring of anger appeared much more spontaneous than the frequent set piece battles between police and anarchist youths who often spark violence during Greek demonstrations . The marches came amid a 24 - hour nationwide general strike that grounded all flights to and from Greece , shut down ports , schools and government services and left hospitals working with emergency medical staff . The Acropolis and all other ancient sites were closed , while journalists also walked off the job , suspending television and radio news broadcasts .

Prime Minister George Papandreou vowed Wednesday that those responsible for the deaths would be found and brought to justice . He told Parliament that \"a demonstration is one thing and murder is quite another . \" The two women and a man were killed during demonstrations by tens of thousands who marched through Athens . The national strike was held to protest the austerity measures announced last weekend so that Greece can get a $144 billion bailout from the International Monetary fund and other European nations . Three people died when an Athens bank went up in flames Wednesday as tens of thousands of Greeks took to the streets to protest harsh spending cuts aimed at saving the country from bankruptcy . The fire brigade said the bodies were found in the wreckage of a Marfin Bank branch , on the route of the march in the city center . Demonstrators chanting \"thieves , thieves\" attempted to break through a riot police cordon guarding Parliament and chased the ceremonial guards away from the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in front of the building . An estimated 100 , 000 people took to the streets as part of nationwide strikes to protest austerity measures imposed as a condition of bailout loans from the International Monetary Fund and other eurozone governments . The bailout is needed to keep heavily indebted Greece from defaulting on its debts . The loans are aimed at preventing Athens' debt troubles from becoming a wider crisis for the Euro by engulfing other financially troubled countries such as Spain and Portugal . But the rioting underlined skepticism that the Greek government could keep up its end of the bargain , helping drive the Euro below $1 . 29 for the first time in over a year . Union reaction until now had been relatively muted by Greece's volatile standards , although the country has been hit by a series of strikes . But anger has mounted after the announcement of new austerity measures , which were essential to unlock the loans . Papandreou on Sunday announced cuts in salaries and pensions for civil servants , and another round of consumer tax increases , as a condition of the bailout . In Germany , Chancellor Angela Merkel urged parliament to quickly pass the country's share of the bailout - - 22 billion Euros over three years . The goal is passage by Friday ; Greece faces a May 19 due date on debt it says it can't repay without the bailout . \"Nothing less than the future of Europe , and with that the future of Germany in Europe , is at stake , \" Merkel told lawmakers . \"We are at a fork in the road . \" Extensive clashes took place a broad swathe of central Athens , with hundreds of people battering store fronts and smashing paving stones to throw at the police , who responded with stun grenades and volleys of tear gas that left clouds of smoke hovering over the streets . Violence also broke out in the northern city of Thessaloniki , where another 20 , 000 people marched through the city center , with youths smashing windows of stores and fast food restaurants . The outpouring of anger appeared much more spontaneous than the frequent set piece battles between police and anarchist youths who often spark violence during Greek demonstrations . The marches came amid a 24 - hour nationwide general strike that grounded all flights to and from Greece , shut down ports , schools and government services and left hospitals working with emergency medical staff . The Acropolis and all other ancient sites were closed , while journalists also walked off the job , suspending television and radio news broadcasts .

Prime Minister George Papandreou vowed Wednesday that those responsible for the deaths would be found and brought to justice . He told Parliament that \"a demonstration is one thing and murder is quite another . \" The two women and a man were killed during demonstrations by tens of thousands who marched through Athens . The national strike was held to protest the austerity measures announced last weekend so that Greece can get a $144 billion bailout from the International Monetary fund and other European nations . Three people died when an Athens bank went up in flames Wednesday as tens of thousands of Greeks took to the streets to protest harsh spending cuts aimed at saving the country from bankruptcy . The fire brigade said the bodies were found in the wreckage of a Marfin Bank branch , on the route of the march in the city center . Demonstrators chanting \"thieves , thieves\" attempted to break through a riot police cordon guarding Parliament and chased the ceremonial guards away from the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in front of the building . An estimated 100 , 000 people took to the streets as part of nationwide strikes to protest austerity measures imposed as a condition of bailout loans from the International Monetary Fund and other eurozone governments . The bailout is needed to keep heavily indebted Greece from defaulting on its debts . The loans are aimed at preventing Athens' debt troubles from becoming a wider crisis for the Euro by engulfing other financially troubled countries such as Spain and Portugal . But the rioting underlined skepticism that the Greek government could keep up its end of the bargain , helping drive the Euro below $1 . 29 for the first time in over a year . Union reaction until now had been relatively muted by Greece's volatile standards , although the country has been hit by a series of strikes . But anger has mounted after the announcement of new austerity measures , which were essential to unlock the loans . Papandreou on Sunday announced cuts in salaries and pensions for civil servants , and another round of consumer tax increases , as a condition of the bailout . In Germany , Chancellor Angela Merkel urged parliament to quickly pass the country's share of the bailout - - 22 billion Euros over three years . The goal is passage by Friday ; Greece faces a May 19 due date on debt it says it can't repay without the bailout . \"Nothing less than the future of Europe , and with that the future of Germany in Europe , is at stake , \" Merkel told lawmakers . \"We are at a fork in the road . \" Extensive clashes took place a broad swathe of central Athens , with hundreds of people battering store fronts and smashing paving stones to throw at the police , who responded with stun grenades and volleys of tear gas that left clouds of smoke hovering over the streets . Violence also broke out in the northern city of Thessaloniki , where another 20 , 000 people marched through the city center , with youths smashing windows of stores and fast food restaurants . The outpouring of anger appeared much more spontaneous than the frequent set piece battles between police and anarchist youths who often spark violence during Greek demonstrations . The marches came amid a 24 - hour nationwide general strike that grounded all flights to and from Greece , shut down ports , schools and government services and left hospitals working with emergency medical staff . The Acropolis and all other ancient sites were closed , while journalists also walked off the job , suspending television and radio news broadcasts .

Prime Minister George Papandreou vowed Wednesday that those responsible for the deaths would be found and brought to justice . He told Parliament that \"a demonstration is one thing and murder is quite another . \" The two women and a man were killed during demonstrations by tens of thousands who marched through Athens . The national strike was held to protest the austerity measures announced last weekend so that Greece can get a $144 billion bailout from the International Monetary fund and other European nations . Three people died when an Athens bank went up in flames Wednesday as tens of thousands of Greeks took to the streets to protest harsh spending cuts aimed at saving the country from bankruptcy . The fire brigade said the bodies were found in the wreckage of a Marfin Bank branch , on the route of the march in the city center . Demonstrators chanting \"thieves , thieves\" attempted to break through a riot police cordon guarding Parliament and chased the ceremonial guards away from the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in front of the building . An estimated 100 , 000 people took to the streets as part of nationwide strikes to protest austerity measures imposed as a condition of bailout loans from the International Monetary Fund and other eurozone governments . The bailout is needed to keep heavily indebted Greece from defaulting on its debts . The loans are aimed at preventing Athens' debt troubles from becoming a wider crisis for the Euro by engulfing other financially troubled countries such as Spain and Portugal . But the rioting underlined skepticism that the Greek government could keep up its end of the bargain , helping drive the Euro below $1 . 29 for the first time in over a year . Union reaction until now had been relatively muted by Greece's volatile standards , although the country has been hit by a series of strikes . But anger has mounted after the announcement of new austerity measures , which were essential to unlock the loans . Papandreou on Sunday announced cuts in salaries and pensions for civil servants , and another round of consumer tax increases , as a condition of the bailout . In Germany , Chancellor Angela Merkel urged parliament to quickly pass the country's share of the bailout - - 22 billion Euros over three years . The goal is passage by Friday ; Greece faces a May 19 due date on debt it says it can't repay without the bailout . \"Nothing less than the future of Europe , and with that the future of Germany in Europe , is at stake , \" Merkel told lawmakers . \"We are at a fork in the road . \" Extensive clashes took place a broad swathe of central Athens , with hundreds of people battering store fronts and smashing paving stones to throw at the police , who responded with stun grenades and volleys of tear gas that left clouds of smoke hovering over the streets . Violence also broke out in the northern city of Thessaloniki , where another 20 , 000 people marched through the city center , with youths smashing windows of stores and fast food restaurants . The outpouring of anger appeared much more spontaneous than the frequent set piece battles between police and anarchist youths who often spark violence during Greek demonstrations . The marches came amid a 24 - hour nationwide general strike that grounded all flights to and from Greece , shut down ports , schools and government services and left hospitals working with emergency medical staff . The Acropolis and all other ancient sites were closed , while journalists also walked off the job , suspending television and radio news broadcasts .

Prime Minister George Papandreou vowed Wednesday that those responsible for the deaths would be found and brought to justice . He told Parliament that \"a demonstration is one thing and murder is quite another . \" The two women and a man were killed during demonstrations by tens of thousands who marched through Athens . The national strike was held to protest the austerity measures announced last weekend so that Greece can get a $144 billion bailout from the International Monetary fund and other European nations . Three people died when an Athens bank went up in flames Wednesday as tens of thousands of Greeks took to the streets to protest harsh spending cuts aimed at saving the country from bankruptcy . The fire brigade said the bodies were found in the wreckage of a Marfin Bank branch , on the route of the march in the city center . Demonstrators chanting \"thieves , thieves\" attempted to break through a riot police cordon guarding Parliament and chased the ceremonial guards away from the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in front of the building . An estimated 100 , 000 people took to the streets as part of nationwide strikes to protest austerity measures imposed as a condition of bailout loans from the International Monetary Fund and other eurozone governments . The bailout is needed to keep heavily indebted Greece from defaulting on its debts . The loans are aimed at preventing Athens' debt troubles from becoming a wider crisis for the Euro by engulfing other financially troubled countries such as Spain and Portugal . But the rioting underlined skepticism that the Greek government could keep up its end of the bargain , helping drive the Euro below $1 . 29 for the first time in over a year . Union reaction until now had been relatively muted by Greece's volatile standards , although the country has been hit by a series of strikes . But anger has mounted after the announcement of new austerity measures , which were essential to unlock the loans . Papandreou on Sunday announced cuts in salaries and pensions for civil servants , and another round of consumer tax increases , as a condition of the bailout . In Germany , Chancellor Angela Merkel urged parliament to quickly pass the country's share of the bailout - - 22 billion Euros over three years . The goal is passage by Friday ; Greece faces a May 19 due date on debt it says it can't repay without the bailout . \"Nothing less than the future of Europe , and with that the future of Germany in Europe , is at stake , \" Merkel told lawmakers . \"We are at a fork in the road . \" Extensive clashes took place a broad swathe of central Athens , with hundreds of people battering store fronts and smashing paving stones to throw at the police , who responded with stun grenades and volleys of tear gas that left clouds of smoke hovering over the streets . Violence also broke out in the northern city of Thessaloniki , where another 20 , 000 people marched through the city center , with youths smashing windows of stores and fast food restaurants . The outpouring of anger appeared much more spontaneous than the frequent set piece battles between police and anarchist youths who often spark violence during Greek demonstrations . The marches came amid a 24 - hour nationwide general strike that grounded all flights to and from Greece , shut down ports , schools and government services and left hospitals working with emergency medical staff . The Acropolis and all other ancient sites were closed , while journalists also walked off the job , suspending television and radio news broadcasts .

Prime Minister George Papandreou vowed Wednesday that those responsible for the deaths would be found and brought to justice . He told Parliament that \"a demonstration is one thing and murder is quite another . \" The two women and a man were killed during demonstrations by tens of thousands who marched through Athens . The national strike was held to protest the austerity measures announced last weekend so that Greece can get a $144 billion bailout from the International Monetary fund and other European nations . Three people died when an Athens bank went up in flames Wednesday as tens of thousands of Greeks took to the streets to protest harsh spending cuts aimed at saving the country from bankruptcy . The fire brigade said the bodies were found in the wreckage of a Marfin Bank branch , on the route of the march in the city center . Demonstrators chanting \"thieves , thieves\" attempted to break through a riot police cordon guarding Parliament and chased the ceremonial guards away from the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in front of the building . An estimated 100 , 000 people took to the streets as part of nationwide strikes to protest austerity measures imposed as a condition of bailout loans from the International Monetary Fund and other eurozone governments . The bailout is needed to keep heavily indebted Greece from defaulting on its debts . The loans are aimed at preventing Athens' debt troubles from becoming a wider crisis for the Euro by engulfing other financially troubled countries such as Spain and Portugal . But the rioting underlined skepticism that the Greek government could keep up its end of the bargain , helping drive the Euro below $1 . 29 for the first time in over a year . Union reaction until now had been relatively muted by Greece's volatile standards , although the country has been hit by a series of strikes . But anger has mounted after the announcement of new austerity measures , which were essential to unlock the loans . Papandreou on Sunday announced cuts in salaries and pensions for civil servants , and another round of consumer tax increases , as a condition of the bailout . In Germany , Chancellor Angela Merkel urged parliament to quickly pass the country's share of the bailout - - 22 billion Euros over three years . The goal is passage by Friday ; Greece faces a May 19 due date on debt it says it can't repay without the bailout . \"Nothing less than the future of Europe , and with that the future of Germany in Europe , is at stake , \" Merkel told lawmakers . \"We are at a fork in the road . \" Extensive clashes took place a broad swathe of central Athens , with hundreds of people battering store fronts and smashing paving stones to throw at the police , who responded with stun grenades and volleys of tear gas that left clouds of smoke hovering over the streets . Violence also broke out in the northern city of Thessaloniki , where another 20 , 000 people marched through the city center , with youths smashing windows of stores and fast food restaurants . The outpouring of anger appeared much more spontaneous than the frequent set piece battles between police and anarchist youths who often spark violence during Greek demonstrations . The marches came amid a 24 - hour nationwide general strike that grounded all flights to and from Greece , shut down ports , schools and government services and left hospitals working with emergency medical staff . The Acropolis and all other ancient sites were closed , while journalists also walked off the job , suspending television and radio news broadcasts .

But they say low - income Greeks will suffer disproportionately from the measures , which aim to save $40 billion - - the country's current budget deficit - - through 2012 . \"These people are losing their rights , they are losing their future , \" said Yiannis Panagopoulos , head of GSEE , one of the two largest union organizations . \"The country cannot surrender without a fight . \" IMF head Dominique Strauss - Kahn warned that the crisis could spread to other countries despite the rescue package's efforts to contain it . \"Everyone must remain extremely vigilant , \" to this risk , Strauss - Kahn said in an interview published in French newspaper Le Parisien Wednesday . \"I completely understand the Greek populations' anger , its incomprehension at the size of the economic catastrophe , \" Strauss - Kahn said . But Greeks must also understand that without these measures , \"the situation would be infinitely more serious , \" he said . Those who are feeling the crunch are outraged that they have to pay for what they see as politicians' mismanagement of their country's economy . \"We'll be on the streets every day , every day ! You never win unless you fight , \" said 76 - year - old Constantinos Doganis , who gets euro345 a month from his farming pension fund . \"It's our fault too , all the mistakes made by politicians over 30 years , all the people who cheat on their taxes , \" he said . \"But they are behaving like buzzards - - the Germans borrow money at 3 percent and then lend it to us for 5 . Why ? \" Despite the strike , the draft bill of the new austerity measures is to be voted on Thursday . Prime Minister George Papandreou's Socialists hold a comfortable majority of 160 in the 300 - seat Parliament , and with a simple majority of 151 votes needed , the bill is expected to be passed easily .", "e0": "killed", "e1": "protests", "e0_pos": [297, 303], "e1_pos": [354, 362], "lab": "CAUSE"}

Behind her another mother was seen shot in her arm before staggering against a wall while trying to hide her own son from the alleged gang members' stray gunfire from a nearby rooftop . This frightening surveillance video was presented at the Brooklyn Supreme Court on Thursday during the trial of two men accused in killing Zurana Horton , 34 , a mother of 12 , in 2011 and wounding two others , including an 11 - year - old girl . Prosecutors say Andrew Lopez , 20 , an alleged 8 Block gang member fired the shots meant for rival gang members from the Howard Projects while his brother Jonathan Carrasquillo , 24 , gave the orders . 'When me and my son were on the floor , I noticed Mrs Horton fall down . I honestly thought she was shot in the head . There was blood , ' said Unique Armstead , who was shot along with an 11 - year - old girl nearby according to the New York post . Mrs Armstead says that just before the shots were fired she passed a group of young men arguing on the street about a gun . Her testimony matched prosecutors' claims . Feeling uneasy , she says 'I speed - walked to my son , and I held him . I was scared . I was trying to get out of harm's way . ' She took her son into a nearby store to wait it out . When the fight appeared to die down , she says she slipped back onto the street with her son by her side when a stray bullet shot straight into her arm . She next saw Horton fall down dead . Mrs Horton is seen sprawled out on the sidewalk beside a pool of blood on the surveillance video . Witnesses are seen cowering in fear around her . 'At the time , I thought it was a brick , but it was a bullet , ' Mrs Armstead said of her injury . Lopez , who was 18 at the time of the shooting , confessed to being the rooftop sniper according to initial reports by the New York Daily News . The gunman said the shooting near Public School 298 in Brownsville had stemmed from a turf war between two Brooklyn gangs . Lopez told police that 'he did not mean to shoot the ladies , ' the source said . A second witness had expected to testify in the shooting on Thursday as well but after threatened with death by the brother of the alleged gunman , their testimony has been delayed until Monday . 'The man is an emotional wreck , ' Brooklyn Supreme Court Judge Vincent Del Giudice said , according to the Post . Lopez has been linked to a Brooklyn gang known as '8 Block , ' who police say are engaged in a turf battle with the neighboring Young Guns gang . NYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly said : 'We're certainly pleased with the fact that the investigation has identified Mr . Lopez and he's made statements and apparently made a full confession , ' the Daily News reported . Lopez told police he was aiming for rival gang members when a stray bullet hit the mother of 13 who was collecting her children from school .

Prosecutors say Andrew Lopez , 20 , an alleged 8 Block gang member fired the shots meant for rival gang members from the Howard Projects while his brother Jonathan Carrasquillo , 24 , gave the orders . 'When me and my son were on the floor , I noticed Mrs Horton fall down . I honestly thought she was shot in the head . There was blood , ' said Unique Armstead , who was shot along with an 11 - year - old girl nearby according to the New York post . Mrs Armstead says that just before the shots were fired she passed a group of young men arguing on the street about a gun . Her testimony matched prosecutors' claims . Feeling uneasy , she says 'I speed - walked to my son , and I held him . I was scared . I was trying to get out of harm's way . ' She took her son into a nearby store to wait it out . When the fight appeared to die down , she says she slipped back onto the street with her son by her side when a stray bullet shot straight into her arm . She next saw Horton fall down dead . Mrs Horton is seen sprawled out on the sidewalk beside a pool of blood on the surveillance video . Witnesses are seen cowering in fear around her . 'At the time , I thought it was a brick , but it was a bullet , ' Mrs Armstead said of her injury . Lopez , who was 18 at the time of the shooting , confessed to being the rooftop sniper according to initial reports by the New York Daily News . The gunman said the shooting near Public School 298 in Brownsville had stemmed from a turf war between two Brooklyn gangs . Lopez told police that 'he did not mean to shoot the ladies , ' the source said . A second witness had expected to testify in the shooting on Thursday as well but after threatened with death by the brother of the alleged gunman , their testimony has been delayed until Monday . 'The man is an emotional wreck , ' Brooklyn Supreme Court Judge Vincent Del Giudice said , according to the Post . Lopez has been linked to a Brooklyn gang known as '8 Block , ' who police say are engaged in a turf battle with the neighboring Young Guns gang . NYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly said : 'We're certainly pleased with the fact that the investigation has identified Mr . Lopez and he's made statements and apparently made a full confession , ' the Daily News reported . Lopez told police he was aiming for rival gang members when a stray bullet hit the mother of 13 who was collecting her children from school . Horton was planning to marry her boyfriend on Valentine's Day in 2012 . Also arrested were Lopez' half - brother , 17 - year - old Kristian , and Carrasquillo . All three live in a fifth - floor apartment inside 1800 Pitkin Ave . , the same building from where the gunman opened fire , police said . That apartment building is said to be where 8 Block got their name , the Post reported in 2011 . Carrasquillo was charged with murder , and Kristian Lopez was arrested for possession of a baseball bat , police said . Andrew Lopez had a previous arrest for walking down Pitkin Ave . brandishing a loaded gun three years ago , sources told the Daily News . The shooting frenzy in which at least 12 shots were fired began just 13 minutes after school finished .

Tuesday the crowd was mostly calm , but on Wednesday \u2014 the same day Gray's autopsy showed he had been shot seven times \u2014 part of the 200 person crowd became unruly . The night began with hope that Gray's mother would speak at a vigil alongside mothers of local shooting victims , but the night turned when about 30 young men showed up in the shadows across the street . \"They were staying in the dark area of the street , \" a witness told CNN . \"You just knew it was going to turn into the cops trying to contain those kids who were obviously gonna go for it . That just stopped the original intention of the night . \" The witness said the teenagers suddenly took off , fanning through streets and side streets , followed by the sound of glass breaking and metal store - front gates being pulled down .

The string of incidents has amplified the distrustful friction between the neighborhood's informal crews of armed teenagers and its aggressive police , whom residents say make prejudiced decisions based on race .

Violence along the poorly defined border since South Sudan's independence in July has strained ties between the two former civil war foes .

A Reuters correspondent heard a large explosion in the Yida refugee camp , then saw a crater about two meters ( 6 . 6 feet ) wide , an unexploded bomb wedged in the side of a school building and a white aircraft flying north . Witnesses said there were three further explosions at 3 p . m . ( 1200 GMT ) .

Khartoum reported fresh clashes in the state Thursday . There were no immediate reports of any casualties at the camp , less than 25 km ( 15 miles ) from the border with Sudan . A spokesman for the Enough Project , an activist group that works to end genocide , said the group confirmed there were no dead or wounded . \"The refugees need to be safe and need to be protected .

Khalid said Sudanese forces fought rebels in South Kordofan about five kilometers south of the town of Taludi Thursday , killing dozens and destroying a tank and other military vehicles . Fighting has also broken out in Sudan's Blue Nile state this year . The two states are home to tens of thousands of fighters who sided with the south during the war but were left in Sudan when South Sudan seceded , analysts say .

Yvonne Hiller , 43 , had gotten into an argument Thursday evening with her co - workers at the northeast Philadelphia plant , police said . After she was disciplined , she went to her vehicle , made several phone calls , and then grabbed a . 357 Magnum and used it to force her way past security guards at the front gate . About 100 people were at work at the plant , which makes Nabisco cookies and crackers . Hiller walked to the third - floor mixing area and found four people in the break room . She had no quarrels with one woman and told her to leave . She then opened fire on the others , Philadelphia Homicide Capt . James Clark said . \"She believed they were spraying chemicals at her , saying things behind her back , \" Clark said . After leaving the break room , Hiller went down a hallway and fired shots at the supervisor who had suspended her and at a mechanic who was using a walkie - talkie to alert police and co - workers to her whereabouts , police said . She missed both . Hiller finally went to a second - floor office and called police to tell them what she had done , authorities said . Seven other workers were hiding in a closet nearby . Cpl . Janice Leader , a 911 dispatcher , told reporters Friday that Hiller called 911 , saying \"I'm the one you're looking for\" and reporting that she had been harassed at work . Keeping her on the line , Leader said she told Hiller to put the gun down and place her hands on her head so officers wouldn't take any aggressive action against her . When tactical police who had entered the plant found her , Hiller was in a fetal position on the floor , the gun beside her . Police called the mechanic a hero who \"did a phenomenal job\" in alerting employees to evacuate the building and directing officers to where Hiller was . \"By following the suspect at great peril to himself \u2013 and we can see that by the fact that he was shot at and almost hit \u2013 he reduced our tactical problem quite dramatically , \" Chief Inspector Joe Sullivan said .

The plant will remain closed indefinitely , Kraft said . \"We suspended the employee when she became agitated and used profanity . We wanted the opportunity to investigate the situation , \" Kraft said in a statement Friday . Hiller was charged with two counts of murder , one count of attempted murder , aggravated assault and other charges . She had a permit to carry the gun , authorities said .

Catherine Hillgen , who has lived on the tidy middle - class city block for about 45 years , said Hiller moved in several years ago with her son but recently has been living alone .

Yvonne Hiller , 43 , had gotten into an argument Thursday evening with her co - workers at the northeast Philadelphia plant , police said . After she was disciplined , she went to her vehicle , made several phone calls , and then grabbed a . 357 Magnum and used it to force her way past security guards at the front gate . About 100 people were at work at the plant , which makes Nabisco cookies and crackers . Hiller walked to the third - floor mixing area and found four people in the break room . She had no quarrels with one woman and told her to leave . She then opened fire on the others , Philadelphia Homicide Capt . James Clark said . \"She believed they were spraying chemicals at her , saying things behind her back , \" Clark said . After leaving the break room , Hiller went down a hallway and fired shots at the supervisor who had suspended her and at a mechanic who was using a walkie - talkie to alert police and co - workers to her whereabouts , police said . She missed both . Hiller finally went to a second - floor office and called police to tell them what she had done , authorities said . Seven other workers were hiding in a closet nearby . Cpl . Janice Leader , a 911 dispatcher , told reporters Friday that Hiller called 911 , saying \"I'm the one you're looking for\" and reporting that she had been harassed at work . Keeping her on the line , Leader said she told Hiller to put the gun down and place her hands on her head so officers wouldn't take any aggressive action against her . When tactical police who had entered the plant found her , Hiller was in a fetal position on the floor , the gun beside her . Police called the mechanic a hero who \"did a phenomenal job\" in alerting employees to evacuate the building and directing officers to where Hiller was . \"By following the suspect at great peril to himself \u2013 and we can see that by the fact that he was shot at and almost hit \u2013 he reduced our tactical problem quite dramatically , \" Chief Inspector Joe Sullivan said . Police identified the victims as Tanya Renee Wilson , 47 ; LaTonya Sharon Brown , 36 ; and Bryant A . Dalton , 39 , all of Philadelphia . Wilson and Brown died at the plant . Dalton , shot in the neck , remained in intensive care Friday at Jefferson University Hospital , police said . The plant will remain closed indefinitely , Kraft said . \"We suspended the employee when she became agitated and used profanity . We wanted the opportunity to investigate the situation , \" Kraft said in a statement Friday . Hiller was charged with two counts of murder , one count of attempted murder , aggravated assault and other charges . She had a permit to carry the gun , authorities said . Hiller has worked for Kraft for about 15 years , and had been in repeated arguments there in the past several years , a few of them physical , Clark said . Yet a next - door neighbor described Hiller as a quiet woman who kept to herself but said she was polite and exchanged pleasantries when they saw each other . Catherine Hillgen , who has lived on the tidy middle - class city block for about 45 years , said Hiller moved in several years ago with her son but recently has been living alone .

Yvonne Hiller , 43 , had gotten into an argument Thursday evening with her co - workers at the northeast Philadelphia plant , police said . After she was disciplined , she went to her vehicle , made several phone calls , and then grabbed a . 357 Magnum and used it to force her way past security guards at the front gate . About 100 people were at work at the plant , which makes Nabisco cookies and crackers . Hiller walked to the third - floor mixing area and found four people in the break room . She had no quarrels with one woman and told her to leave . She then opened fire on the others , Philadelphia Homicide Capt . James Clark said . \"She believed they were spraying chemicals at her , saying things behind her back , \" Clark said . After leaving the break room , Hiller went down a hallway and fired shots at the supervisor who had suspended her and at a mechanic who was using a walkie - talkie to alert police and co - workers to her whereabouts , police said . She missed both . Hiller finally went to a second - floor office and called police to tell them what she had done , authorities said . Seven other workers were hiding in a closet nearby . Cpl . Janice Leader , a 911 dispatcher , told reporters Friday that Hiller called 911 , saying \"I'm the one you're looking for\" and reporting that she had been harassed at work . Keeping her on the line , Leader said she told Hiller to put the gun down and place her hands on her head so officers wouldn't take any aggressive action against her . When tactical police who had entered the plant found her , Hiller was in a fetal position on the floor , the gun beside her . Police called the mechanic a hero who \"did a phenomenal job\" in alerting employees to evacuate the building and directing officers to where Hiller was . \"By following the suspect at great peril to himself \u2013 and we can see that by the fact that he was shot at and almost hit \u2013 he reduced our tactical problem quite dramatically , \" Chief Inspector Joe Sullivan said . Police identified the victims as Tanya Renee Wilson , 47 ; LaTonya Sharon Brown , 36 ; and Bryant A . Dalton , 39 , all of Philadelphia . Wilson and Brown died at the plant . Dalton , shot in the neck , remained in intensive care Friday at Jefferson University Hospital , police said . The plant will remain closed indefinitely , Kraft said . \"We suspended the employee when she became agitated and used profanity . We wanted the opportunity to investigate the situation , \" Kraft said in a statement Friday . Hiller was charged with two counts of murder , one count of attempted murder , aggravated assault and other charges . She had a permit to carry the gun , authorities said . Hiller has worked for Kraft for about 15 years , and had been in repeated arguments there in the past several years , a few of them physical , Clark said . Yet a next - door neighbor described Hiller as a quiet woman who kept to herself but said she was polite and exchanged pleasantries when they saw each other . Catherine Hillgen , who has lived on the tidy middle - class city block for about 45 years , said Hiller moved in several years ago with her son but recently has been living alone .
