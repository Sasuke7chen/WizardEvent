Then came the anger : a Monday evening vigil marred by an unruly young mob thrashing its way through local businesses ; a second protest the next night ; and another on Wednesday night , after which , the police said , someone hit an officer in the face with a brick , another brick was thrown through the window of a police van , and there were 46 arrests \u2014 mostly for disorderly conduct . Two officers suffered minor injuries . By the time an autopsy of the 16 - year - old was released Wednesday , the tension in East Flatbush could be measured in the silently flashing lights of squad cars parked at tight intervals along Church Avenue . For some , the sight of extra police officers meant a potential reprieve in an area troubled by crime . For others , it was anything but reassuring . The police said that two plainclothes officers fatally shot the teenager , Kimani Gray , just before 11 : 30 p . m . on Saturday after he brandished a revolver and pointed it at them . The police commissioner , Raymond W . Kelly , said Tuesday that the police had interviewed three witnesses , \u201c two of which say that the officers said , \u2018 Don \u2019 t move . \u2019 \u201d \u201c Another witness said an officer says , \u2018 Freeze , \u2019 \u201d he said . The officers then fired 11 shots , the police said . Seven bullets hit Mr . Gray , including three that entered his body from the rear , according to the New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner . The autopsy did not establish the order in which the bullets struck Mr . Gray , or determine the path of the bullets , which might make clearer if Mr . Gray had his back to the officers when he was shot , or if he had twisted away after being struck from the front . But the findings , inconclusive though they were , appeared likely to heighten the tensions of a community already distrustful of the police and increasingly incensed about the shooting of the teenager . On Wednesday night , about 200 people attended the vigil . The gathering became unruly when about half of them splintered off and marched to a nearby police precinct station house . After officers in riot gear set up a roadblock on Church Avenue , Mr . Gray \u2019 s sister Mahnefah tried to cross the street and was put into a police car . She was given a summons and released . Some of the protesters shouted , \u201c That \u2019 s the sister , \u201d then started throwing bottles when the police would not release her . Someone hurled a chair . Screams could be heard as skirmishes broke out on side streets . For local residents , many of whom voiced skepticism about the official account , the situation surrounding Mr . Gray \u2019 s death was grimly familiar . Less than a year before , and only blocks away , a narcotics detective shot and killed an unarmed 23 - year - old woman , Shantel Davis , as she tried to flee the police in a car that had been reported stolen at gunpoint , the police said at the time . Vigils followed that shooting as well . But soon the rhythms of daily life returned , marked by what young men and women said was a daily backbeat of police stops . \u201c You try to put it out of your mind , \u201d said Ms . Davis \u2019 s sister Crystal . In interviews around East Flatbush , many spoke of a Police Department that , in its aggressive pursuit of gangs and informal criminal crews , had sown distrust , especially among young men and women , who feel that their encounters with officers often have racial overtones . At a barbershop along Church Avenue , two men on Tuesday were discussing the recent shooting when an Asian delivery cyclist pulled onto the sidewalk across the street . \u201c See that guy ? \u201d said Elverton Thomas , 39 , a black man and telemarketer who was there for a haircut . \u201c He can ride on the sidewalk . We can \u2019 t . \u201d His barber , Julian Clark , also black , concurred . Two years before , he said , an officer stopped him in front of the shop for sidewalk riding , and then arrested him after the officer said his identification had expired ; he spent a day in custody sorting it out , he said . \u201c They have a hard time because there \u2019 s a lot of crime in the neighborhood , \u201d he said of the police . \u201c But when they play hardball , they end up going after innocent people , too . \u201d The seemingly constant presence of the police in the lives of many youths \u2014 both on the street and , increasingly , monitoring conversations on social media \u2014 has left many feeling suffocated , said Shanduke McPhatter , 35 , an ex - gang member who works with young men in the neighborhood . \u201c I understand the state of mind that these youths have , \u201d he said . \u201c The problem is there is no relationship with the police . \u201d At the same time , he said , the situation on the streets has grown more complex for law enforcement : gangs are less organized , replaced instead by informal crews with few requirements and in which leadership is frequently up for grabs among increasingly young members . \u201c The police say , \u2018 Look at these kids , they \u2019 re wild , \u2019 \u201d Mr . McPhatter said . \u201c And then they use that as an excuse to be wild themselves . \u201d The Rev . Terry Lee , who runs a local youth ministry and acts as a liaison to the police , said many of the neighborhood shootings involved \u201c kids killing kids \u201d and lamented that the community did not rise up more frequently in anger over those shootings . But he said he understood why . \u201c The community we \u2019 re living in can get dangerous at times , \u201d he said . \u201c People are afraid of retaliation . \u201d Mr . Lee said the local 67th Precinct had grown more open to the community in recent years . \u201c The problem is , people still don \u2019 t want to go to the police , \u201d he said . The autopsy report on Mr . Gray did not specify which of the seven bullets caused the death of the teenager ; that determination awaits further investigation . One bullet entered his left shoulder in the rear ; two other bullets struck the back of his thighs , one in the left thigh and one in the right . Two bullets struck from the front , hitting his right thigh ; one bullet entered his left side , striking his lower rib cage ; and the last bullet hit his left lower forearm . John C . Cerar , the former commander for firearms training at the Police Department , said many factors could explain the wounds to the front and back of Mr . Gray \u2019 s body . \u201c Most of the time , it \u2019 s the person making a turn , or the position of the officers , \u201d he said , or some combination of the two . Once that person has a gun , he said , the threat to the officers is imminent . Mr . Gray \u2019 s revolver was loaded with four bullets , the police said . Mr . Kelly , the police commissioner , said Tuesday that there was \u201c nothing to indicate that this shooting was outside the guidelines . \u201d Mr . Cerar concurred , saying , \u201c Under the reported circumstances , it appears to be a good shooting . \u201d But raw feeling in the neighborhood fueled accounts at wide variance with that provided by the police . Some said Mr . Gray , while armed , did not point the gun ; others said they had heard that there had been no gun at all , or that his hands had been in the air . A family friend , Kevin Blacks , 33 , said he was not surprised that the autopsy had found that Mr . Gray had been shot so many times or hit from behind . He said he had spoken to Mr . Gray \u2019 s parents . \u201c The dad is shook , \u201d Mr . Blacks said , standing by a makeshift memorial for Mr . Gray . \u201c He doesn \u2019 t sleep . He doesn \u2019 t talk . He \u2019 s still in a dream . \u201d Local elected officials and clergy members , seeking to lower the temperature in the neighborhood , mostly did not issue new statements Wednesday . \u201c Our focus right now is to get the funeral service together , \u201d said Gilford T . Monrose , a local pastor and community leader who is working with the family on the service ; a date had yet to be set , he said . On Tuesday , police investigators could be seen inside a Rite Aid store where , the night before , a group of at least three dozen mostly young people briefly rampaged through the aisles , turning over displays and assaulting one customer who tried to intervene . The police released store surveillance video and later announced the arrest of a 19 - year - old , saying he was one of three who hit the customer and took his cellphone . \u201c Nothing justifies that , \u201d Mr . Kelly said . He said at a City Council hearing on Tuesday that the violence had been caused by a disorderly group that broke away from the vigil and did not constitute a riot , as some had termed it . \u201c That belittles it , \u201d City Councilman Jumaane D . Williams said later , referring to the community anger after the police shooting . \u201c So now we \u2019 re going to wait for something worse , for something that meets the true definition of a riot ? \u201d", "e0": "Anger", "e1": "killed", "e0_pos": [155, 160], "e1_pos": [299, 305], "lab": "CAUSE"}

Vigils followed that shooting as well . But soon the rhythms of daily life returned , marked by what young men and women said was a daily backbeat of police stops . \u201c You try to put it out of your mind , \u201d said Ms . Davis \u2019 s sister Crystal . In interviews around East Flatbush , many spoke of a Police Department that , in its aggressive pursuit of gangs and informal criminal crews , had sown distrust , especially among young men and women , who feel that their encounters with officers often have racial overtones . At a barbershop along Church Avenue , two men on Tuesday were discussing the recent shooting when an Asian delivery cyclist pulled onto the sidewalk across the street . \u201c See that guy ? \u201d said Elverton Thomas , 39 , a black man and telemarketer who was there for a haircut . \u201c He can ride on the sidewalk . We can \u2019 t . \u201d His barber , Julian Clark , also black , concurred . Two years before , he said , an officer stopped him in front of the shop for sidewalk riding , and then arrested him after the officer said his identification had expired ; he spent a day in custody sorting it out , he said . \u201c They have a hard time because there \u2019 s a lot of crime in the neighborhood , \u201d he said of the police . \u201c But when they play hardball , they end up going after innocent people , too . \u201d The seemingly constant presence of the police in the lives of many youths \u2014 both on the street and , increasingly , monitoring conversations on social media \u2014 has left many feeling suffocated , said Shanduke McPhatter , 35 , an ex - gang member who works with young men in the neighborhood . \u201c I understand the state of mind that these youths have , \u201d he said . \u201c The problem is there is no relationship with the police . \u201d At the same time , he said , the situation on the streets has grown more complex for law enforcement : gangs are less organized , replaced instead by informal crews with few requirements and in which leadership is frequently up for grabs among increasingly young members . \u201c The police say , \u2018 Look at these kids , they \u2019 re wild , \u2019 \u201d Mr . McPhatter said . \u201c And then they use that as an excuse to be wild themselves . \u201d The Rev . Terry Lee , who runs a local youth ministry and acts as a liaison to the police , said many of the neighborhood shootings involved \u201c kids killing kids \u201d and lamented that the community did not rise up more frequently in anger over those shootings . But he said he understood why . \u201c The community we \u2019 re living in can get dangerous at times , \u201d he said . \u201c People are afraid of retaliation . \u201d Mr . Lee said the local 67th Precinct had grown more open to the community in recent years . \u201c The problem is , people still don \u2019 t want to go to the police , \u201d he said . The autopsy report on Mr . Gray did not specify which of the seven bullets caused the death of the teenager ; that determination awaits further investigation . One bullet entered his left shoulder in the rear ; two other bullets struck the back of his thighs , one in the left thigh and one in the right . Two bullets struck from the front , hitting his right thigh ; one bullet entered his left side , striking his lower rib cage ; and the last bullet hit his left lower forearm . John C . Cerar , the former commander for firearms training at the Police Department , said many factors could explain the wounds to the front and back of Mr . Gray \u2019 s body . \u201c Most of the time , it \u2019 s the person making a turn , or the position of the officers , \u201d he said , or some combination of the two . Once that person has a gun , he said , the threat to the officers is imminent . Mr . Gray \u2019 s revolver was loaded with four bullets , the police said . Mr . Kelly , the police commissioner , said Tuesday that there was \u201c nothing to indicate that this shooting was outside the guidelines . \u201d Mr . Cerar concurred , saying , \u201c Under the reported circumstances , it appears to be a good shooting . \u201d But raw feeling in the neighborhood fueled accounts at wide variance with that provided by the police . Some said Mr . Gray , while armed , did not point the gun ; others said they had heard that there had been no gun at all , or that his hands had been in the air . A family friend , Kevin Blacks , 33 , said he was not surprised that the autopsy had found that Mr . Gray had been shot so many times or hit from behind . He said he had spoken to Mr . Gray \u2019 s parents . \u201c The dad is shook , \u201d Mr . Blacks said , standing by a makeshift memorial for Mr . Gray . \u201c He doesn \u2019 t sleep . He doesn \u2019 t talk . He \u2019 s still in a dream . \u201d Local elected officials and clergy members , seeking to lower the temperature in the neighborhood , mostly did not issue new statements Wednesday . \u201c Our focus right now is to get the funeral service together , \u201d said Gilford T . Monrose , a local pastor and community leader who is working with the family on the service ; a date had yet to be set , he said . On Tuesday , police investigators could be seen inside a Rite Aid store where , the night before , a group of at least three dozen mostly young people briefly rampaged through the aisles , turning over displays and assaulting one customer who tried to intervene . The police released store surveillance video and later announced the arrest of a 19 - year - old , saying he was one of three who hit the customer and took his cellphone . \u201c Nothing justifies that , \u201d Mr . Kelly said . He said at a City Council hearing on Tuesday that the violence had been caused by a disorderly group that broke away from the vigil and did not constitute a riot , as some had termed it . \u201c That belittles it , \u201d City Councilman Jumaane D . Williams said later , referring to the community anger after the police shooting . \u201c So now we \u2019 re going to wait for something worse , for something that meets the true definition of a riot ? \u201d", "e0": "anger", "e1": "marred", "e0_pos": [371, 376], "e1_pos": [402, 408], "lab": "EFFECT"}

Then came the anger : a Monday evening vigil marred by an unruly young mob thrashing its way through local businesses ; a second protest the next night ; and another on Wednesday night , after which , the police said , someone hit an officer in the face with a brick , another brick was thrown through the window of a police van , and there were 46 arrests \u2014 mostly for disorderly conduct . Two officers suffered minor injuries . By the time an autopsy of the 16 - year - old was released Wednesday , the tension in East Flatbush could be measured in the silently flashing lights of squad cars parked at tight intervals along Church Avenue . For some , the sight of extra police officers meant a potential reprieve in an area troubled by crime . For others , it was anything but reassuring . The police said that two plainclothes officers fatally shot the teenager , Kimani Gray , just before 11 : 30 p . m . on Saturday after he brandished a revolver and pointed it at them . The police commissioner , Raymond W . Kelly , said Tuesday that the police had interviewed three witnesses , \u201c two of which say that the officers said , \u2018 Don \u2019 t move . \u2019 \u201d \u201c Another witness said an officer says , \u2018 Freeze , \u2019 \u201d he said . The officers then fired 11 shots , the police said . Seven bullets hit Mr . Gray , including three that entered his body from the rear , according to the New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner . The autopsy did not establish the order in which the bullets struck Mr . Gray , or determine the path of the bullets , which might make clearer if Mr . Gray had his back to the officers when he was shot , or if he had twisted away after being struck from the front . But the findings , inconclusive though they were , appeared likely to heighten the tensions of a community already distrustful of the police and increasingly incensed about the shooting of the teenager . On Wednesday night , about 200 people attended the vigil . The gathering became unruly when about half of them splintered off and marched to a nearby police precinct station house . After officers in riot gear set up a roadblock on Church Avenue , Mr . Gray \u2019 s sister Mahnefah tried to cross the street and was put into a police car . She was given a summons and released . Some of the protesters shouted , \u201c That \u2019 s the sister , \u201d then started throwing bottles when the police would not release her . Someone hurled a chair . Screams could be heard as skirmishes broke out on side streets . For local residents , many of whom voiced skepticism about the official account , the situation surrounding Mr .

Lee said the local 67th Precinct had grown more open to the community in recent years . \u201c The problem is , people still don \u2019 t want to go to the police , \u201d he said . The autopsy report on Mr . Gray did not specify which of the seven bullets caused the death of the teenager ; that determination awaits further investigation . One bullet entered his left shoulder in the rear ; two other bullets struck the back of his thighs , one in the left thigh and one in the right . Two bullets struck from the front , hitting his right thigh ; one bullet entered his left side , striking his lower rib cage ; and the last bullet hit his left lower forearm . John C . Cerar , the former commander for firearms training at the Police Department , said many factors could explain the wounds to the front and back of Mr . Gray \u2019 s body . \u201c Most of the time , it \u2019 s the person making a turn , or the position of the officers , \u201d he said , or some combination of the two . Once that person has a gun , he said , the threat to the officers is imminent . Mr . Gray \u2019 s revolver was loaded with four bullets , the police said . Mr . Kelly , the police commissioner , said Tuesday that there was \u201c nothing to indicate that this shooting was outside the guidelines . \u201d Mr . Cerar concurred , saying , \u201c Under the reported circumstances , it appears to be a good shooting . \u201d But raw feeling in the neighborhood fueled accounts at wide variance with that provided by the police . Some said Mr . Gray , while armed , did not point the gun ; others said they had heard that there had been no gun at all , or that his hands had been in the air . A family friend , Kevin Blacks , 33 , said he was not surprised that the autopsy had found that Mr . Gray had been shot so many times or hit from behind . He said he had spoken to Mr . Gray \u2019 s parents . \u201c The dad is shook , \u201d Mr . Blacks said , standing by a makeshift memorial for Mr . Gray . \u201c He doesn \u2019 t sleep . He doesn \u2019 t talk . He \u2019 s still in a dream . \u201d Local elected officials and clergy members , seeking to lower the temperature in the neighborhood , mostly did not issue new statements Wednesday . \u201c Our focus right now is to get the funeral service together , \u201d said Gilford T . Monrose , a local pastor and community leader who is working with the family on the service ; a date had yet to be set , he said . On Tuesday , police investigators could be seen inside a Rite Aid store where , the night before , a group of at least three dozen mostly young people briefly rampaged through the aisles , turning over displays and assaulting one customer who tried to intervene . The police released store surveillance video and later announced the arrest of a 19 - year - old , saying he was one of three who hit the customer and took his cellphone . \u201c Nothing justifies that , \u201d Mr . Kelly said . He said at a City Council hearing on Tuesday that the violence had been caused by a disorderly group that broke away from the vigil and did not constitute a riot , as some had termed it . \u201c That belittles it , \u201d City Councilman Jumaane D .

Then came the anger : a Monday evening vigil marred by an unruly young mob thrashing its way through local businesses ; a second protest the next night ; and another on Wednesday night , after which , the police said , someone hit an officer in the face with a brick , another brick was thrown through the window of a police van , and there were 46 arrests \u2014 mostly for disorderly conduct . Two officers suffered minor injuries . By the time an autopsy of the 16 - year - old was released Wednesday , the tension in East Flatbush could be measured in the silently flashing lights of squad cars parked at tight intervals along Church Avenue . For some , the sight of extra police officers meant a potential reprieve in an area troubled by crime . For others , it was anything but reassuring . The police said that two plainclothes officers fatally shot the teenager , Kimani Gray , just before 11 : 30 p . m . on Saturday after he brandished a revolver and pointed it at them . The police commissioner , Raymond W . Kelly , said Tuesday that the police had interviewed three witnesses , \u201c two of which say that the officers said , \u2018 Don \u2019 t move . \u2019 \u201d \u201c Another witness said an officer says , \u2018 Freeze , \u2019 \u201d he said . The officers then fired 11 shots , the police said . Seven bullets hit Mr . Gray , including three that entered his body from the rear , according to the New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner . The autopsy did not establish the order in which the bullets struck Mr . Gray , or determine the path of the bullets , which might make clearer if Mr . Gray had his back to the officers when he was shot , or if he had twisted away after being struck from the front . But the findings , inconclusive though they were , appeared likely to heighten the tensions of a community already distrustful of the police and increasingly incensed about the shooting of the teenager . On Wednesday night , about 200 people attended the vigil . The gathering became unruly when about half of them splintered off and marched to a nearby police precinct station house . After officers in riot gear set up a roadblock on Church Avenue , Mr . Gray \u2019 s sister Mahnefah tried to cross the street and was put into a police car . She was given a summons and released . Some of the protesters shouted , \u201c That \u2019 s the sister , \u201d then started throwing bottles when the police would not release her . Someone hurled a chair . Screams could be heard as skirmishes broke out on side streets . For local residents , many of whom voiced skepticism about the official account , the situation surrounding Mr . Gray \u2019 s death was grimly familiar . Less than a year before , and only blocks away , a narcotics detective shot and killed an unarmed 23 - year - old woman , Shantel Davis , as she tried to flee the police in a car that had been reported stolen at gunpoint , the police said at the time . Vigils followed that shooting as well . But soon the rhythms of daily life returned , marked by what young men and women said was a daily backbeat of police stops . \u201c You try to put it out of your mind , \u201d said Ms . Davis \u2019 s sister Crystal . In interviews around East Flatbush , many spoke of a Police Department that , in its aggressive pursuit of gangs and informal criminal crews , had sown distrust , especially among young men and women , who feel that their encounters with officers often have racial overtones . At a barbershop along Church Avenue , two men on Tuesday were discussing the recent shooting when an Asian delivery cyclist pulled onto the sidewalk across the street . \u201c See that guy ? \u201d said Elverton Thomas , 39 , a black man and telemarketer who was there for a haircut . \u201c He can ride on the sidewalk . We can \u2019 t . \u201d His barber , Julian Clark , also black , concurred . Two years before , he said , an officer stopped him in front of the shop for sidewalk riding , and then arrested him after the officer said his identification had expired ; he spent a day in custody sorting it out , he said . \u201c They have a hard time because there \u2019 s a lot of crime in the neighborhood , \u201d he said of the police . \u201c But when they play hardball , they end up going after innocent people , too . \u201d The seemingly constant presence of the police in the lives of many youths \u2014 both on the street and , increasingly , monitoring conversations on social media \u2014 has left many feeling suffocated , said Shanduke McPhatter , 35 , an ex - gang member who works with young men in the neighborhood . \u201c I understand the state of mind that these youths have , \u201d he said . \u201c The problem is there is no relationship with the police . \u201d At the same time , he said , the situation on the streets has grown more complex for law enforcement : gangs are less organized , replaced instead by informal crews with few requirements and in which leadership is frequently up for grabs among increasingly young members . \u201c The police say , \u2018 Look at these kids , they \u2019 re wild , \u2019 \u201d Mr . McPhatter said . \u201c And then they use that as an excuse to be wild themselves . \u201d The Rev .

Then came the anger : a Monday evening vigil marred by an unruly young mob thrashing its way through local businesses ; a second protest the next night ; and another on Wednesday night , after which , the police said , someone hit an officer in the face with a brick , another brick was thrown through the window of a police van , and there were 46 arrests \u2014 mostly for disorderly conduct . Two officers suffered minor injuries . By the time an autopsy of the 16 - year - old was released Wednesday , the tension in East Flatbush could be measured in the silently flashing lights of squad cars parked at tight intervals along Church Avenue . For some , the sight of extra police officers meant a potential reprieve in an area troubled by crime . For others , it was anything but reassuring . The police said that two plainclothes officers fatally shot the teenager , Kimani Gray , just before 11 : 30 p . m . on Saturday after he brandished a revolver and pointed it at them . The police commissioner , Raymond W . Kelly , said Tuesday that the police had interviewed three witnesses , \u201c two of which say that the officers said , \u2018 Don \u2019 t move . \u2019 \u201d \u201c Another witness said an officer says , \u2018 Freeze , \u2019 \u201d he said . The officers then fired 11 shots , the police said . Seven bullets hit Mr . Gray , including three that entered his body from the rear , according to the New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner . The autopsy did not establish the order in which the bullets struck Mr . Gray , or determine the path of the bullets , which might make clearer if Mr . Gray had his back to the officers when he was shot , or if he had twisted away after being struck from the front . But the findings , inconclusive though they were , appeared likely to heighten the tensions of a community already distrustful of the police and increasingly incensed about the shooting of the teenager . On Wednesday night , about 200 people attended the vigil . The gathering became unruly when about half of them splintered off and marched to a nearby police precinct station house . After officers in riot gear set up a roadblock on Church Avenue , Mr . Gray \u2019 s sister Mahnefah tried to cross the street and was put into a police car . She was given a summons and released . Some of the protesters shouted , \u201c That \u2019 s the sister , \u201d then started throwing bottles when the police would not release her . Someone hurled a chair . Screams could be heard as skirmishes broke out on side streets . For local residents , many of whom voiced skepticism about the official account , the situation surrounding Mr . Gray \u2019 s death was grimly familiar . Less than a year before , and only blocks away , a narcotics detective shot and killed an unarmed 23 - year - old woman , Shantel Davis , as she tried to flee the police in a car that had been reported stolen at gunpoint , the police said at the time . Vigils followed that shooting as well . But soon the rhythms of daily life returned , marked by what young men and women said was a daily backbeat of police stops . \u201c You try to put it out of your mind , \u201d said Ms . Davis \u2019 s sister Crystal . In interviews around East Flatbush , many spoke of a Police Department that , in its aggressive pursuit of gangs and informal criminal crews , had sown distrust , especially among young men and women , who feel that their encounters with officers often have racial overtones . At a barbershop along Church Avenue , two men on Tuesday were discussing the recent shooting when an Asian delivery cyclist pulled onto the sidewalk across the street . \u201c See that guy ? \u201d said Elverton Thomas , 39 , a black man and telemarketer who was there for a haircut . \u201c He can ride on the sidewalk . We can \u2019 t . \u201d His barber , Julian Clark , also black , concurred . Two years before , he said , an officer stopped him in front of the shop for sidewalk riding , and then arrested him after the officer said his identification had expired ; he spent a day in custody sorting it out , he said . \u201c They have a hard time because there \u2019 s a lot of crime in the neighborhood , \u201d he said of the police . \u201c But when they play hardball , they end up going after innocent people , too . \u201d The seemingly constant presence of the police in the lives of many youths \u2014 both on the street and , increasingly , monitoring conversations on social media \u2014 has left many feeling suffocated , said Shanduke McPhatter , 35 , an ex - gang member who works with young men in the neighborhood . \u201c I understand the state of mind that these youths have , \u201d he said . \u201c The problem is there is no relationship with the police . \u201d At the same time , he said , the situation on the streets has grown more complex for law enforcement : gangs are less organized , replaced instead by informal crews with few requirements and in which leadership is frequently up for grabs among increasingly young members . \u201c The police say , \u2018 Look at these kids , they \u2019 re wild , \u2019 \u201d Mr . McPhatter said . \u201c And then they use that as an excuse to be wild themselves . \u201d The Rev . Terry Lee , who runs a local youth ministry and acts as a liaison to the police , said many of the neighborhood shootings involved \u201c kids killing kids \u201d and lamented that the community did not rise up more frequently in anger over those shootings . But he said he understood why . \u201c The community we \u2019 re living in can get dangerous at times , \u201d he said . \u201c People are afraid of retaliation . \u201d Mr . Lee said the local 67th Precinct had grown more open to the community in recent years . \u201c The problem is , people still don \u2019 t want to go to the police , \u201d he said . The autopsy report on Mr . Gray did not specify which of the seven bullets caused the death of the teenager ; that determination awaits further investigation . One bullet entered his left shoulder in the rear ; two other bullets struck the back of his thighs , one in the left thigh and one in the right . Two bullets struck from the front , hitting his right thigh ; one bullet entered his left side , striking his lower rib cage ; and the last bullet hit his left lower forearm . John C . Cerar , the former commander for firearms training at the Police Department , said many factors could explain the wounds to the front and back of Mr . Gray \u2019 s body . \u201c Most of the time , it \u2019 s the person making a turn , or the position of the officers , \u201d he said , or some combination of the two . Once that person has a gun , he said , the threat to the officers is imminent . Mr . Gray \u2019 s revolver was loaded with four bullets , the police said . Mr . Kelly , the police commissioner , said Tuesday that there was \u201c nothing to indicate that this shooting was outside the guidelines . \u201d Mr . Cerar concurred , saying , \u201c Under the reported circumstances , it appears to be a good shooting . \u201d But raw feeling in the neighborhood fueled accounts at wide variance with that provided by the police . Some said Mr . Gray , while armed , did not point the gun ; others said they had heard that there had been no gun at all , or that his hands had been in the air . A family friend , Kevin Blacks , 33 , said he was not surprised that the autopsy had found that Mr . Gray had been shot so many times or hit from behind . He said he had spoken to Mr . Gray \u2019 s parents . \u201c The dad is shook , \u201d Mr . Blacks said , standing by a makeshift memorial for Mr . Gray . \u201c He doesn \u2019 t sleep . He doesn \u2019 t talk .

By the time an autopsy of the 16 - year - old was released Wednesday , the tension in East Flatbush could be measured in the silently flashing lights of squad cars parked at tight intervals along Church Avenue . For some , the sight of extra police officers meant a potential reprieve in an area troubled by crime . For others , it was anything but reassuring . The police said that two plainclothes officers fatally shot the teenager , Kimani Gray , just before 11 : 30 p . m . on Saturday after he brandished a revolver and pointed it at them . The police commissioner , Raymond W . Kelly , said Tuesday that the police had interviewed three witnesses , \u201c two of which say that the officers said , \u2018 Don \u2019 t move . \u2019 \u201d \u201c Another witness said an officer says , \u2018 Freeze , \u2019 \u201d he said . The officers then fired 11 shots , the police said . Seven bullets hit Mr . Gray , including three that entered his body from the rear , according to the New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner . The autopsy did not establish the order in which the bullets struck Mr . Gray , or determine the path of the bullets , which might make clearer if Mr . Gray had his back to the officers when he was shot , or if he had twisted away after being struck from the front . But the findings , inconclusive though they were , appeared likely to heighten the tensions of a community already distrustful of the police and increasingly incensed about the shooting of the teenager . On Wednesday night , about 200 people attended the vigil . The gathering became unruly when about half of them splintered off and marched to a nearby police precinct station house . After officers in riot gear set up a roadblock on Church Avenue , Mr . Gray \u2019 s sister Mahnefah tried to cross the street and was put into a police car . She was given a summons and released . Some of the protesters shouted , \u201c That \u2019 s the sister , \u201d then started throwing bottles when the police would not release her . Someone hurled a chair . Screams could be heard as skirmishes broke out on side streets . For local residents , many of whom voiced skepticism about the official account , the situation surrounding Mr . Gray \u2019 s death was grimly familiar . Less than a year before , and only blocks away , a narcotics detective shot and killed an unarmed 23 - year - old woman , Shantel Davis , as she tried to flee the police in a car that had been reported stolen at gunpoint , the police said at the time . Vigils followed that shooting as well . But soon the rhythms of daily life returned , marked by what young men and women said was a daily backbeat of police stops . \u201c You try to put it out of your mind , \u201d said Ms . Davis \u2019 s sister Crystal . In interviews around East Flatbush , many spoke of a Police Department that , in its aggressive pursuit of gangs and informal criminal crews , had sown distrust , especially among young men and women , who feel that their encounters with officers often have racial overtones . At a barbershop along Church Avenue , two men on Tuesday were discussing the recent shooting when an Asian delivery cyclist pulled onto the sidewalk across the street . \u201c See that guy ? \u201d said Elverton Thomas , 39 , a black man and telemarketer who was there for a haircut . \u201c He can ride on the sidewalk . We can \u2019 t . \u201d His barber , Julian Clark , also black , concurred . Two years before , he said , an officer stopped him in front of the shop for sidewalk riding , and then arrested him after the officer said his identification had expired ; he spent a day in custody sorting it out , he said . \u201c They have a hard time because there \u2019 s a lot of crime in the neighborhood , \u201d he said of the police . \u201c But when they play hardball , they end up going after innocent people , too . \u201d The seemingly constant presence of the police in the lives of many youths \u2014 both on the street and , increasingly , monitoring conversations on social media \u2014 has left many feeling suffocated , said Shanduke McPhatter , 35 , an ex - gang member who works with young men in the neighborhood . \u201c I understand the state of mind that these youths have , \u201d he said . \u201c The problem is there is no relationship with the police . \u201d At the same time , he said , the situation on the streets has grown more complex for law enforcement : gangs are less organized , replaced instead by informal crews with few requirements and in which leadership is frequently up for grabs among increasingly young members . \u201c The police say , \u2018 Look at these kids , they \u2019 re wild , \u2019 \u201d Mr . McPhatter said . \u201c And then they use that as an excuse to be wild themselves . \u201d The Rev . Terry Lee , who runs a local youth ministry and acts as a liaison to the police , said many of the neighborhood shootings involved \u201c kids killing kids \u201d and lamented that the community did not rise up more frequently in anger over those shootings . But he said he understood why . \u201c The community we \u2019 re living in can get dangerous at times , \u201d he said . \u201c People are afraid of retaliation . \u201d Mr . Lee said the local 67th Precinct had grown more open to the community in recent years . \u201c The problem is , people still don \u2019 t want to go to the police , \u201d he said . The autopsy report on Mr . Gray did not specify which of the seven bullets caused the death of the teenager ; that determination awaits further investigation . One bullet entered his left shoulder in the rear ; two other bullets struck the back of his thighs , one in the left thigh and one in the right . Two bullets struck from the front , hitting his right thigh ; one bullet entered his left side , striking his lower rib cage ; and the last bullet hit his left lower forearm . John C . Cerar , the former commander for firearms training at the Police Department , said many factors could explain the wounds to the front and back of Mr . Gray \u2019 s body . \u201c Most of the time , it \u2019 s the person making a turn , or the position of the officers , \u201d he said , or some combination of the two . Once that person has a gun , he said , the threat to the officers is imminent . Mr . Gray \u2019 s revolver was loaded with four bullets , the police said . Mr . Kelly , the police commissioner , said Tuesday that there was \u201c nothing to indicate that this shooting was outside the guidelines . \u201d Mr . Cerar concurred , saying , \u201c Under the reported circumstances , it appears to be a good shooting . \u201d But raw feeling in the neighborhood fueled accounts at wide variance with that provided by the police . Some said Mr . Gray , while armed , did not point the gun ; others said they had heard that there had been no gun at all , or that his hands had been in the air . A family friend , Kevin Blacks , 33 , said he was not surprised that the autopsy had found that Mr . Gray had been shot so many times or hit from behind . He said he had spoken to Mr . Gray \u2019 s parents . \u201c The dad is shook , \u201d Mr . Blacks said , standing by a makeshift memorial for Mr . Gray . \u201c He doesn \u2019 t sleep . He doesn \u2019 t talk . He \u2019 s still in a dream . \u201d Local elected officials and clergy members , seeking to lower the temperature in the neighborhood , mostly did not issue new statements Wednesday . \u201c Our focus right now is to get the funeral service together , \u201d said Gilford T . Monrose , a local pastor and community leader who is working with the family on the service ; a date had yet to be set , he said . On Tuesday , police investigators could be seen inside a Rite Aid store where , the night before , a group of at least three dozen mostly young people briefly rampaged through the aisles , turning over displays and assaulting one customer who tried to intervene . The police released store surveillance video and later announced the arrest of a 19 - year - old , saying he was one of three who hit the customer and took his cellphone . \u201c Nothing justifies that , \u201d Mr . Kelly said . He said at a City Council hearing on Tuesday that the violence had been caused by a disorderly group that broke away from the vigil and did not constitute a riot , as some had termed it . \u201c That belittles it , \u201d City Councilman Jumaane D . Williams said later , referring to the community anger after the police shooting . \u201c So now we \u2019 re going to wait for something worse , for something that meets the true definition of a riot ? \u201d", "e0": "Killing", "e1": "vigil", "e0_pos": [205, 212], "e1_pos": [396, 401], "lab": "EFFECT"}

But soon the rhythms of daily life returned , marked by what young men and women said was a daily backbeat of police stops . \u201c You try to put it out of your mind , \u201d said Ms . Davis \u2019 s sister Crystal . In interviews around East Flatbush , many spoke of a Police Department that , in its aggressive pursuit of gangs and informal criminal crews , had sown distrust , especially among young men and women , who feel that their encounters with officers often have racial overtones . At a barbershop along Church Avenue , two men on Tuesday were discussing the recent shooting when an Asian delivery cyclist pulled onto the sidewalk across the street . \u201c See that guy ? \u201d said Elverton Thomas , 39 , a black man and telemarketer who was there for a haircut . \u201c He can ride on the sidewalk . We can \u2019 t . \u201d His barber , Julian Clark , also black , concurred . Two years before , he said , an officer stopped him in front of the shop for sidewalk riding , and then arrested him after the officer said his identification had expired ; he spent a day in custody sorting it out , he said . \u201c They have a hard time because there \u2019 s a lot of crime in the neighborhood , \u201d he said of the police . \u201c But when they play hardball , they end up going after innocent people , too . \u201d The seemingly constant presence of the police in the lives of many youths \u2014 both on the street and , increasingly , monitoring conversations on social media \u2014 has left many feeling suffocated , said Shanduke McPhatter , 35 , an ex - gang member who works with young men in the neighborhood . \u201c I understand the state of mind that these youths have , \u201d he said . \u201c The problem is there is no relationship with the police . \u201d At the same time , he said , the situation on the streets has grown more complex for law enforcement : gangs are less organized , replaced instead by informal crews with few requirements and in which leadership is frequently up for grabs among increasingly young members . \u201c The police say , \u2018 Look at these kids , they \u2019 re wild , \u2019 \u201d Mr . McPhatter said . \u201c And then they use that as an excuse to be wild themselves . \u201d The Rev . Terry Lee , who runs a local youth ministry and acts as a liaison to the police , said many of the neighborhood shootings involved \u201c kids killing kids \u201d and lamented that the community did not rise up more frequently in anger over those shootings . But he said he understood why . \u201c The community we \u2019 re living in can get dangerous at times , \u201d he said . \u201c People are afraid of retaliation . \u201d Mr . Lee said the local 67th Precinct had grown more open to the community in recent years . \u201c The problem is , people still don \u2019 t want to go to the police , \u201d he said . The autopsy report on Mr . Gray did not specify which of the seven bullets caused the death of the teenager ; that determination awaits further investigation . One bullet entered his left shoulder in the rear ; two other bullets struck the back of his thighs , one in the left thigh and one in the right . Two bullets struck from the front , hitting his right thigh ; one bullet entered his left side , striking his lower rib cage ; and the last bullet hit his left lower forearm . John C . Cerar , the former commander for firearms training at the Police Department , said many factors could explain the wounds to the front and back of Mr . Gray \u2019 s body . \u201c Most of the time , it \u2019 s the person making a turn , or the position of the officers , \u201d he said , or some combination of the two . Once that person has a gun , he said , the threat to the officers is imminent . Mr . Gray \u2019 s revolver was loaded with four bullets , the police said . Mr . Kelly , the police commissioner , said Tuesday that there was \u201c nothing to indicate that this shooting was outside the guidelines . \u201d Mr . Cerar concurred , saying , \u201c Under the reported circumstances , it appears to be a good shooting . \u201d But raw feeling in the neighborhood fueled accounts at wide variance with that provided by the police . Some said Mr . Gray , while armed , did not point the gun ; others said they had heard that there had been no gun at all , or that his hands had been in the air . A family friend , Kevin Blacks , 33 , said he was not surprised that the autopsy had found that Mr . Gray had been shot so many times or hit from behind . He said he had spoken to Mr . Gray \u2019 s parents . \u201c The dad is shook , \u201d Mr . Blacks said , standing by a makeshift memorial for Mr . Gray . \u201c He doesn \u2019 t sleep . He doesn \u2019 t talk . He \u2019 s still in a dream . \u201d Local elected officials and clergy members , seeking to lower the temperature in the neighborhood , mostly did not issue new statements Wednesday . \u201c Our focus right now is to get the funeral service together , \u201d said Gilford T . Monrose , a local pastor and community leader who is working with the family on the service ; a date had yet to be set , he said . On Tuesday , police investigators could be seen inside a Rite Aid store where , the night before , a group of at least three dozen mostly young people briefly rampaged through the aisles , turning over displays and assaulting one customer who tried to intervene . The police released store surveillance video and later announced the arrest of a 19 - year - old , saying he was one of three who hit the customer and took his cellphone . \u201c Nothing justifies that , \u201d Mr . Kelly said . He said at a City Council hearing on Tuesday that the violence had been caused by a disorderly group that broke away from the vigil and did not constitute a riot , as some had termed it . \u201c That belittles it , \u201d City Councilman Jumaane D . Williams said later , referring to the community anger after the police shooting . \u201c So now we \u2019 re going to wait for something worse , for something that meets the true definition of a riot ? \u201d", "e0": "Anger", "e1": "conduct", "e0_pos": [155, 160], "e1_pos": [738, 745], "lab": "EFFECT"}

Then came the anger : a Monday evening vigil marred by an unruly young mob thrashing its way through local businesses ; a second protest the next night ; and another on Wednesday night , after which , the police said , someone hit an officer in the face with a brick , another brick was thrown through the window of a police van , and there were 46 arrests \u2014 mostly for disorderly conduct . Two officers suffered minor injuries . By the time an autopsy of the 16 - year - old was released Wednesday , the tension in East Flatbush could be measured in the silently flashing lights of squad cars parked at tight intervals along Church Avenue . For some , the sight of extra police officers meant a potential reprieve in an area troubled by crime . For others , it was anything but reassuring . The police said that two plainclothes officers fatally shot the teenager , Kimani Gray , just before 11 : 30 p . m . on Saturday after he brandished a revolver and pointed it at them . The police commissioner , Raymond W . Kelly , said Tuesday that the police had interviewed three witnesses , \u201c two of which say that the officers said , \u2018 Don \u2019 t move . \u2019 \u201d \u201c Another witness said an officer says , \u2018 Freeze , \u2019 \u201d he said . The officers then fired 11 shots , the police said . Seven bullets hit Mr . Gray , including three that entered his body from the rear , according to the New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner . The autopsy did not establish the order in which the bullets struck Mr . Gray , or determine the path of the bullets , which might make clearer if Mr . Gray had his back to the officers when he was shot , or if he had twisted away after being struck from the front . But the findings , inconclusive though they were , appeared likely to heighten the tensions of a community already distrustful of the police and increasingly incensed about the shooting of the teenager . On Wednesday night , about 200 people attended the vigil . The gathering became unruly when about half of them splintered off and marched to a nearby police precinct station house . After officers in riot gear set up a roadblock on Church Avenue , Mr . Gray \u2019 s sister Mahnefah tried to cross the street and was put into a police car . She was given a summons and released . Some of the protesters shouted , \u201c That \u2019 s the sister , \u201d then started throwing bottles when the police would not release her . Someone hurled a chair . Screams could be heard as skirmishes broke out on side streets . For local residents , many of whom voiced skepticism about the official account , the situation surrounding Mr . Gray \u2019 s death was grimly familiar .

The autopsy report on Mr . Gray did not specify which of the seven bullets caused the death of the teenager ; that determination awaits further investigation . One bullet entered his left shoulder in the rear ; two other bullets struck the back of his thighs , one in the left thigh and one in the right . Two bullets struck from the front , hitting his right thigh ; one bullet entered his left side , striking his lower rib cage ; and the last bullet hit his left lower forearm . John C .

Gray \u2019 s body . \u201c Most of the time , it \u2019 s the person making a turn , or the position of the officers , \u201d he said , or some combination of the two .

Kelly , the police commissioner , said Tuesday that there was \u201c nothing to indicate that this shooting was outside the guidelines . \u201d Mr . Cerar concurred , saying , \u201c Under the reported circumstances , it appears to be a good shooting . \u201d But raw feeling in the neighborhood fueled accounts at wide variance with that provided by the police . Some said Mr . Gray , while armed , did not point the gun ; others said they had heard that there had been no gun at all , or that his hands had been in the air . A family friend , Kevin Blacks , 33 , said he was not surprised that the autopsy had found that Mr . Gray had been shot so many times or hit from behind . He said he had spoken to Mr . Gray \u2019 s parents . \u201c The dad is shook , \u201d Mr . Blacks said , standing by a makeshift memorial for Mr . Gray . \u201c He doesn \u2019 t sleep . He doesn \u2019 t talk .

Then came the anger : a Monday evening vigil marred by an unruly young mob thrashing its way through local businesses ; a second protest the next night ; and another on Wednesday night , after which , the police said , someone hit an officer in the face with a brick , another brick was thrown through the window of a police van , and there were 46 arrests \u2014 mostly for disorderly conduct . Two officers suffered minor injuries . By the time an autopsy of the 16 - year - old was released Wednesday , the tension in East Flatbush could be measured in the silently flashing lights of squad cars parked at tight intervals along Church Avenue . For some , the sight of extra police officers meant a potential reprieve in an area troubled by crime . For others , it was anything but reassuring . The police said that two plainclothes officers fatally shot the teenager , Kimani Gray , just before 11 : 30 p . m . on Saturday after he brandished a revolver and pointed it at them . The police commissioner , Raymond W . Kelly , said Tuesday that the police had interviewed three witnesses , \u201c two of which say that the officers said , \u2018 Don \u2019 t move . \u2019 \u201d \u201c Another witness said an officer says , \u2018 Freeze , \u2019 \u201d he said . The officers then fired 11 shots , the police said . Seven bullets hit Mr . Gray , including three that entered his body from the rear , according to the New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner . The autopsy did not establish the order in which the bullets struck Mr . Gray , or determine the path of the bullets , which might make clearer if Mr . Gray had his back to the officers when he was shot , or if he had twisted away after being struck from the front . But the findings , inconclusive though they were , appeared likely to heighten the tensions of a community already distrustful of the police and increasingly incensed about the shooting of the teenager . On Wednesday night , about 200 people attended the vigil . The gathering became unruly when about half of them splintered off and marched to a nearby police precinct station house . After officers in riot gear set up a roadblock on Church Avenue , Mr . Gray \u2019 s sister Mahnefah tried to cross the street and was put into a police car . She was given a summons and released . Some of the protesters shouted , \u201c That \u2019 s the sister , \u201d then started throwing bottles when the police would not release her . Someone hurled a chair . Screams could be heard as skirmishes broke out on side streets . For local residents , many of whom voiced skepticism about the official account , the situation surrounding Mr . Gray \u2019 s death was grimly familiar . Less than a year before , and only blocks away , a narcotics detective shot and killed an unarmed 23 - year - old woman , Shantel Davis , as she tried to flee the police in a car that had been reported stolen at gunpoint , the police said at the time . Vigils followed that shooting as well . But soon the rhythms of daily life returned , marked by what young men and women said was a daily backbeat of police stops . \u201c You try to put it out of your mind , \u201d said Ms . Davis \u2019 s sister Crystal . In interviews around East Flatbush , many spoke of a Police Department that , in its aggressive pursuit of gangs and informal criminal crews , had sown distrust , especially among young men and women , who feel that their encounters with officers often have racial overtones . At a barbershop along Church Avenue , two men on Tuesday were discussing the recent shooting when an Asian delivery cyclist pulled onto the sidewalk across the street . \u201c See that guy ? \u201d said Elverton Thomas , 39 , a black man and telemarketer who was there for a haircut . \u201c He can ride on the sidewalk . We can \u2019 t . \u201d His barber , Julian Clark , also black , concurred . Two years before , he said , an officer stopped him in front of the shop for sidewalk riding , and then arrested him after the officer said his identification had expired ; he spent a day in custody sorting it out , he said . \u201c They have a hard time because there \u2019 s a lot of crime in the neighborhood , \u201d he said of the police . \u201c But when they play hardball , they end up going after innocent people , too . \u201d The seemingly constant presence of the police in the lives of many youths \u2014 both on the street and , increasingly , monitoring conversations on social media \u2014 has left many feeling suffocated , said Shanduke McPhatter , 35 , an ex - gang member who works with young men in the neighborhood . \u201c I understand the state of mind that these youths have , \u201d he said . \u201c The problem is there is no relationship with the police . \u201d At the same time , he said , the situation on the streets has grown more complex for law enforcement : gangs are less organized , replaced instead by informal crews with few requirements and in which leadership is frequently up for grabs among increasingly young members . \u201c The police say , \u2018 Look at these kids , they \u2019 re wild , \u2019 \u201d Mr . McPhatter said . \u201c And then they use that as an excuse to be wild themselves . \u201d The Rev .

Then came the anger : a Monday evening vigil marred by an unruly young mob thrashing its way through local businesses ; a second protest the next night ; and another on Wednesday night , after which , the police said , someone hit an officer in the face with a brick , another brick was thrown through the window of a police van , and there were 46 arrests \u2014 mostly for disorderly conduct . Two officers suffered minor injuries . By the time an autopsy of the 16 - year - old was released Wednesday , the tension in East Flatbush could be measured in the silently flashing lights of squad cars parked at tight intervals along Church Avenue . For some , the sight of extra police officers meant a potential reprieve in an area troubled by crime . For others , it was anything but reassuring . The police said that two plainclothes officers fatally shot the teenager , Kimani Gray , just before 11 : 30 p . m . on Saturday after he brandished a revolver and pointed it at them . The police commissioner , Raymond W . Kelly , said Tuesday that the police had interviewed three witnesses , \u201c two of which say that the officers said , \u2018 Don \u2019 t move . \u2019 \u201d \u201c Another witness said an officer says , \u2018 Freeze , \u2019 \u201d he said . The officers then fired 11 shots , the police said . Seven bullets hit Mr . Gray , including three that entered his body from the rear , according to the New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner . The autopsy did not establish the order in which the bullets struck Mr . Gray , or determine the path of the bullets , which might make clearer if Mr . Gray had his back to the officers when he was shot , or if he had twisted away after being struck from the front . But the findings , inconclusive though they were , appeared likely to heighten the tensions of a community already distrustful of the police and increasingly incensed about the shooting of the teenager . On Wednesday night , about 200 people attended the vigil . The gathering became unruly when about half of them splintered off and marched to a nearby police precinct station house . After officers in riot gear set up a roadblock on Church Avenue , Mr . Gray \u2019 s sister Mahnefah tried to cross the street and was put into a police car . She was given a summons and released . Some of the protesters shouted , \u201c That \u2019 s the sister , \u201d then started throwing bottles when the police would not release her . Someone hurled a chair . Screams could be heard as skirmishes broke out on side streets . For local residents , many of whom voiced skepticism about the official account , the situation surrounding Mr . Gray \u2019 s death was grimly familiar . Less than a year before , and only blocks away , a narcotics detective shot and killed an unarmed 23 - year - old woman , Shantel Davis , as she tried to flee the police in a car that had been reported stolen at gunpoint , the police said at the time . Vigils followed that shooting as well . But soon the rhythms of daily life returned , marked by what young men and women said was a daily backbeat of police stops . \u201c You try to put it out of your mind , \u201d said Ms . Davis \u2019 s sister Crystal . In interviews around East Flatbush , many spoke of a Police Department that , in its aggressive pursuit of gangs and informal criminal crews , had sown distrust , especially among young men and women , who feel that their encounters with officers often have racial overtones . At a barbershop along Church Avenue , two men on Tuesday were discussing the recent shooting when an Asian delivery cyclist pulled onto the sidewalk across the street . \u201c See that guy ? \u201d said Elverton Thomas , 39 , a black man and telemarketer who was there for a haircut . \u201c He can ride on the sidewalk . We can \u2019 t . \u201d His barber , Julian Clark , also black , concurred . Two years before , he said , an officer stopped him in front of the shop for sidewalk riding , and then arrested him after the officer said his identification had expired ; he spent a day in custody sorting it out , he said . \u201c They have a hard time because there \u2019 s a lot of crime in the neighborhood , \u201d he said of the police . \u201c But when they play hardball , they end up going after innocent people , too . \u201d The seemingly constant presence of the police in the lives of many youths \u2014 both on the street and , increasingly , monitoring conversations on social media \u2014 has left many feeling suffocated , said Shanduke McPhatter , 35 , an ex - gang member who works with young men in the neighborhood . \u201c I understand the state of mind that these youths have , \u201d he said . \u201c The problem is there is no relationship with the police . \u201d At the same time , he said , the situation on the streets has grown more complex for law enforcement : gangs are less organized , replaced instead by informal crews with few requirements and in which leadership is frequently up for grabs among increasingly young members . \u201c The police say , \u2018 Look at these kids , they \u2019 re wild , \u2019 \u201d Mr . McPhatter said . \u201c And then they use that as an excuse to be wild themselves . \u201d The Rev . Terry Lee , who runs a local youth ministry and acts as a liaison to the police , said many of the neighborhood shootings involved \u201c kids killing kids \u201d and lamented that the community did not rise up more frequently in anger over those shootings . But he said he understood why . \u201c The community we \u2019 re living in can get dangerous at times , \u201d he said . \u201c People are afraid of retaliation . \u201d Mr . Lee said the local 67th Precinct had grown more open to the community in recent years . \u201c The problem is , people still don \u2019 t want to go to the police , \u201d he said . The autopsy report on Mr . Gray did not specify which of the seven bullets caused the death of the teenager ; that determination awaits further investigation . One bullet entered his left shoulder in the rear ; two other bullets struck the back of his thighs , one in the left thigh and one in the right . Two bullets struck from the front , hitting his right thigh ; one bullet entered his left side , striking his lower rib cage ; and the last bullet hit his left lower forearm . John C . Cerar , the former commander for firearms training at the Police Department , said many factors could explain the wounds to the front and back of Mr . Gray \u2019 s body . \u201c Most of the time , it \u2019 s the person making a turn , or the position of the officers , \u201d he said , or some combination of the two . Once that person has a gun , he said , the threat to the officers is imminent . Mr . Gray \u2019 s revolver was loaded with four bullets , the police said . Mr . Kelly , the police commissioner , said Tuesday that there was \u201c nothing to indicate that this shooting was outside the guidelines . \u201d Mr . Cerar concurred , saying , \u201c Under the reported circumstances , it appears to be a good shooting . \u201d But raw feeling in the neighborhood fueled accounts at wide variance with that provided by the police . Some said Mr . Gray , while armed , did not point the gun ; others said they had heard that there had been no gun at all , or that his hands had been in the air . A family friend , Kevin Blacks , 33 , said he was not surprised that the autopsy had found that Mr . Gray had been shot so many times or hit from behind . He said he had spoken to Mr .

By the time an autopsy of the 16 - year - old was released Wednesday , the tension in East Flatbush could be measured in the silently flashing lights of squad cars parked at tight intervals along Church Avenue . For some , the sight of extra police officers meant a potential reprieve in an area troubled by crime . For others , it was anything but reassuring . The police said that two plainclothes officers fatally shot the teenager , Kimani Gray , just before 11 : 30 p . m . on Saturday after he brandished a revolver and pointed it at them . The police commissioner , Raymond W . Kelly , said Tuesday that the police had interviewed three witnesses , \u201c two of which say that the officers said , \u2018 Don \u2019 t move . \u2019 \u201d \u201c Another witness said an officer says , \u2018 Freeze , \u2019 \u201d he said . The officers then fired 11 shots , the police said . Seven bullets hit Mr . Gray , including three that entered his body from the rear , according to the New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner . The autopsy did not establish the order in which the bullets struck Mr . Gray , or determine the path of the bullets , which might make clearer if Mr . Gray had his back to the officers when he was shot , or if he had twisted away after being struck from the front . But the findings , inconclusive though they were , appeared likely to heighten the tensions of a community already distrustful of the police and increasingly incensed about the shooting of the teenager . On Wednesday night , about 200 people attended the vigil . The gathering became unruly when about half of them splintered off and marched to a nearby police precinct station house . After officers in riot gear set up a roadblock on Church Avenue , Mr . Gray \u2019 s sister Mahnefah tried to cross the street and was put into a police car . She was given a summons and released . Some of the protesters shouted , \u201c That \u2019 s the sister , \u201d then started throwing bottles when the police would not release her . Someone hurled a chair . Screams could be heard as skirmishes broke out on side streets . For local residents , many of whom voiced skepticism about the official account , the situation surrounding Mr . Gray \u2019 s death was grimly familiar . Less than a year before , and only blocks away , a narcotics detective shot and killed an unarmed 23 - year - old woman , Shantel Davis , as she tried to flee the police in a car that had been reported stolen at gunpoint , the police said at the time . Vigils followed that shooting as well . But soon the rhythms of daily life returned , marked by what young men and women said was a daily backbeat of police stops . \u201c You try to put it out of your mind , \u201d said Ms . Davis \u2019 s sister Crystal . In interviews around East Flatbush , many spoke of a Police Department that , in its aggressive pursuit of gangs and informal criminal crews , had sown distrust , especially among young men and women , who feel that their encounters with officers often have racial overtones . At a barbershop along Church Avenue , two men on Tuesday were discussing the recent shooting when an Asian delivery cyclist pulled onto the sidewalk across the street . \u201c See that guy ? \u201d said Elverton Thomas , 39 , a black man and telemarketer who was there for a haircut . \u201c He can ride on the sidewalk . We can \u2019 t . \u201d His barber , Julian Clark , also black , concurred . Two years before , he said , an officer stopped him in front of the shop for sidewalk riding , and then arrested him after the officer said his identification had expired ; he spent a day in custody sorting it out , he said . \u201c They have a hard time because there \u2019 s a lot of crime in the neighborhood , \u201d he said of the police . \u201c But when they play hardball , they end up going after innocent people , too . \u201d The seemingly constant presence of the police in the lives of many youths \u2014 both on the street and , increasingly , monitoring conversations on social media \u2014 has left many feeling suffocated , said Shanduke McPhatter , 35 , an ex - gang member who works with young men in the neighborhood . \u201c I understand the state of mind that these youths have , \u201d he said . \u201c The problem is there is no relationship with the police . \u201d At the same time , he said , the situation on the streets has grown more complex for law enforcement : gangs are less organized , replaced instead by informal crews with few requirements and in which leadership is frequently up for grabs among increasingly young members . \u201c The police say , \u2018 Look at these kids , they \u2019 re wild , \u2019 \u201d Mr . McPhatter said . \u201c And then they use that as an excuse to be wild themselves . \u201d The Rev . Terry Lee , who runs a local youth ministry and acts as a liaison to the police , said many of the neighborhood shootings involved \u201c kids killing kids \u201d and lamented that the community did not rise up more frequently in anger over those shootings . But he said he understood why . \u201c The community we \u2019 re living in can get dangerous at times , \u201d he said . \u201c People are afraid of retaliation . \u201d Mr . Lee said the local 67th Precinct had grown more open to the community in recent years . \u201c The problem is , people still don \u2019 t want to go to the police , \u201d he said . The autopsy report on Mr . Gray did not specify which of the seven bullets caused the death of the teenager ; that determination awaits further investigation . One bullet entered his left shoulder in the rear ; two other bullets struck the back of his thighs , one in the left thigh and one in the right . Two bullets struck from the front , hitting his right thigh ; one bullet entered his left side , striking his lower rib cage ; and the last bullet hit his left lower forearm . John C . Cerar , the former commander for firearms training at the Police Department , said many factors could explain the wounds to the front and back of Mr . Gray \u2019 s body . \u201c Most of the time , it \u2019 s the person making a turn , or the position of the officers , \u201d he said , or some combination of the two . Once that person has a gun , he said , the threat to the officers is imminent . Mr . Gray \u2019 s revolver was loaded with four bullets , the police said . Mr . Kelly , the police commissioner , said Tuesday that there was \u201c nothing to indicate that this shooting was outside the guidelines . \u201d Mr . Cerar concurred , saying , \u201c Under the reported circumstances , it appears to be a good shooting . \u201d But raw feeling in the neighborhood fueled accounts at wide variance with that provided by the police . Some said Mr . Gray , while armed , did not point the gun ; others said they had heard that there had been no gun at all , or that his hands had been in the air . A family friend , Kevin Blacks , 33 , said he was not surprised that the autopsy had found that Mr . Gray had been shot so many times or hit from behind . He said he had spoken to Mr . Gray \u2019 s parents . \u201c The dad is shook , \u201d Mr . Blacks said , standing by a makeshift memorial for Mr . Gray . \u201c He doesn \u2019 t sleep . He doesn \u2019 t talk . He \u2019 s still in a dream . \u201d Local elected officials and clergy members , seeking to lower the temperature in the neighborhood , mostly did not issue new statements Wednesday . \u201c Our focus right now is to get the funeral service together , \u201d said Gilford T . Monrose , a local pastor and community leader who is working with the family on the service ; a date had yet to be set , he said . On Tuesday , police investigators could be seen inside a Rite Aid store where , the night before , a group of at least three dozen mostly young people briefly rampaged through the aisles , turning over displays and assaulting one customer who tried to intervene . The police released store surveillance video and later announced the arrest of a 19 - year - old , saying he was one of three who hit the customer and took his cellphone . \u201c Nothing justifies that , \u201d Mr . Kelly said . He said at a City Council hearing on Tuesday that the violence had been caused by a disorderly group that broke away from the vigil and did not constitute a riot , as some had termed it . \u201c That belittles it , \u201d City Councilman Jumaane D . Williams said later , referring to the community anger after the police shooting . \u201c So now we \u2019 re going to wait for something worse , for something that meets the true definition of a riot ? \u201d", "e0": "anger", "e1": "thrashing", "e0_pos": [371, 376], "e1_pos": [432, 441], "lab": "EFFECT"}

But soon the rhythms of daily life returned , marked by what young men and women said was a daily backbeat of police stops . \u201c You try to put it out of your mind , \u201d said Ms . Davis \u2019 s sister Crystal . In interviews around East Flatbush , many spoke of a Police Department that , in its aggressive pursuit of gangs and informal criminal crews , had sown distrust , especially among young men and women , who feel that their encounters with officers often have racial overtones . At a barbershop along Church Avenue , two men on Tuesday were discussing the recent shooting when an Asian delivery cyclist pulled onto the sidewalk across the street . \u201c See that guy ? \u201d said Elverton Thomas , 39 , a black man and telemarketer who was there for a haircut . \u201c He can ride on the sidewalk . We can \u2019 t . \u201d His barber , Julian Clark , also black , concurred . Two years before , he said , an officer stopped him in front of the shop for sidewalk riding , and then arrested him after the officer said his identification had expired ; he spent a day in custody sorting it out , he said . \u201c They have a hard time because there \u2019 s a lot of crime in the neighborhood , \u201d he said of the police . \u201c But when they play hardball , they end up going after innocent people , too . \u201d The seemingly constant presence of the police in the lives of many youths \u2014 both on the street and , increasingly , monitoring conversations on social media \u2014 has left many feeling suffocated , said Shanduke McPhatter , 35 , an ex - gang member who works with young men in the neighborhood . \u201c I understand the state of mind that these youths have , \u201d he said . \u201c The problem is there is no relationship with the police . \u201d At the same time , he said , the situation on the streets has grown more complex for law enforcement : gangs are less organized , replaced instead by informal crews with few requirements and in which leadership is frequently up for grabs among increasingly young members . \u201c The police say , \u2018 Look at these kids , they \u2019 re wild , \u2019 \u201d Mr . McPhatter said . \u201c And then they use that as an excuse to be wild themselves . \u201d The Rev . Terry Lee , who runs a local youth ministry and acts as a liaison to the police , said many of the neighborhood shootings involved \u201c kids killing kids \u201d and lamented that the community did not rise up more frequently in anger over those shootings . But he said he understood why . \u201c The community we \u2019 re living in can get dangerous at times , \u201d he said . \u201c People are afraid of retaliation . \u201d Mr . Lee said the local 67th Precinct had grown more open to the community in recent years . \u201c The problem is , people still don \u2019 t want to go to the police , \u201d he said . The autopsy report on Mr . Gray did not specify which of the seven bullets caused the death of the teenager ; that determination awaits further investigation . One bullet entered his left shoulder in the rear ; two other bullets struck the back of his thighs , one in the left thigh and one in the right . Two bullets struck from the front , hitting his right thigh ; one bullet entered his left side , striking his lower rib cage ; and the last bullet hit his left lower forearm . John C . Cerar , the former commander for firearms training at the Police Department , said many factors could explain the wounds to the front and back of Mr . Gray \u2019 s body . \u201c Most of the time , it \u2019 s the person making a turn , or the position of the officers , \u201d he said , or some combination of the two . Once that person has a gun , he said , the threat to the officers is imminent . Mr . Gray \u2019 s revolver was loaded with four bullets , the police said . Mr . Kelly , the police commissioner , said Tuesday that there was \u201c nothing to indicate that this shooting was outside the guidelines . \u201d Mr . Cerar concurred , saying , \u201c Under the reported circumstances , it appears to be a good shooting . \u201d But raw feeling in the neighborhood fueled accounts at wide variance with that provided by the police . Some said Mr . Gray , while armed , did not point the gun ; others said they had heard that there had been no gun at all , or that his hands had been in the air . A family friend , Kevin Blacks , 33 , said he was not surprised that the autopsy had found that Mr . Gray had been shot so many times or hit from behind . He said he had spoken to Mr . Gray \u2019 s parents . \u201c The dad is shook , \u201d Mr . Blacks said , standing by a makeshift memorial for Mr . Gray . \u201c He doesn \u2019 t sleep . He doesn \u2019 t talk . He \u2019 s still in a dream . \u201d Local elected officials and clergy members , seeking to lower the temperature in the neighborhood , mostly did not issue new statements Wednesday . \u201c Our focus right now is to get the funeral service together , \u201d said Gilford T . Monrose , a local pastor and community leader who is working with the family on the service ; a date had yet to be set , he said . On Tuesday , police investigators could be seen inside a Rite Aid store where , the night before , a group of at least three dozen mostly young people briefly rampaged through the aisles , turning over displays and assaulting one customer who tried to intervene . The police released store surveillance video and later announced the arrest of a 19 - year - old , saying he was one of three who hit the customer and took his cellphone . \u201c Nothing justifies that , \u201d Mr . Kelly said . He said at a City Council hearing on Tuesday that the violence had been caused by a disorderly group that broke away from the vigil and did not constitute a riot , as some had termed it . \u201c That belittles it , \u201d City Councilman Jumaane D . Williams said later , referring to the community anger after the police shooting . \u201c So now we \u2019 re going to wait for something worse , for something that meets the true definition of a riot ? \u201d", "e0": "shot", "e1": "brandished", "e0_pos": [1204, 1208], "e1_pos": [1287, 1297], "lab": "CAUSE"}

Then came the anger : a Monday evening vigil marred by an unruly young mob thrashing its way through local businesses ; a second protest the next night ; and another on Wednesday night , after which , the police said , someone hit an officer in the face with a brick , another brick was thrown through the window of a police van , and there were 46 arrests \u2014 mostly for disorderly conduct . Two officers suffered minor injuries . By the time an autopsy of the 16 - year - old was released Wednesday , the tension in East Flatbush could be measured in the silently flashing lights of squad cars parked at tight intervals along Church Avenue . For some , the sight of extra police officers meant a potential reprieve in an area troubled by crime . For others , it was anything but reassuring . The police said that two plainclothes officers fatally shot the teenager , Kimani Gray , just before 11 : 30 p . m . on Saturday after he brandished a revolver and pointed it at them . The police commissioner , Raymond W . Kelly , said Tuesday that the police had interviewed three witnesses , \u201c two of which say that the officers said , \u2018 Don \u2019 t move . \u2019 \u201d \u201c Another witness said an officer says , \u2018 Freeze , \u2019 \u201d he said . The officers then fired 11 shots , the police said . Seven bullets hit Mr . Gray , including three that entered his body from the rear , according to the New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner . The autopsy did not establish the order in which the bullets struck Mr . Gray , or determine the path of the bullets , which might make clearer if Mr . Gray had his back to the officers when he was shot , or if he had twisted away after being struck from the front . But the findings , inconclusive though they were , appeared likely to heighten the tensions of a community already distrustful of the police and increasingly incensed about the shooting of the teenager . On Wednesday night , about 200 people attended the vigil . The gathering became unruly when about half of them splintered off and marched to a nearby police precinct station house . After officers in riot gear set up a roadblock on Church Avenue , Mr . Gray \u2019 s sister Mahnefah tried to cross the street and was put into a police car . She was given a summons and released . Some of the protesters shouted , \u201c That \u2019 s the sister , \u201d then started throwing bottles when the police would not release her . Someone hurled a chair . Screams could be heard as skirmishes broke out on side streets . For local residents , many of whom voiced skepticism about the official account , the situation surrounding Mr . Gray \u2019 s death was grimly familiar .

The autopsy report on Mr . Gray did not specify which of the seven bullets caused the death of the teenager ; that determination awaits further investigation . One bullet entered his left shoulder in the rear ; two other bullets struck the back of his thighs , one in the left thigh and one in the right . Two bullets struck from the front , hitting his right thigh ; one bullet entered his left side , striking his lower rib cage ; and the last bullet hit his left lower forearm . John C . Cerar , the former commander for firearms training at the Police Department , said many factors could explain the wounds to the front and back of Mr . Gray \u2019 s body . \u201c Most of the time , it \u2019 s the person making a turn , or the position of the officers , \u201d he said , or some combination of the two . Once that person has a gun , he said , the threat to the officers is imminent . Mr . Gray \u2019 s revolver was loaded with four bullets , the police said . Mr . Kelly , the police commissioner , said Tuesday that there was \u201c nothing to indicate that this shooting was outside the guidelines . \u201d Mr . Cerar concurred , saying , \u201c Under the reported circumstances , it appears to be a good shooting . \u201d But raw feeling in the neighborhood fueled accounts at wide variance with that provided by the police . Some said Mr . Gray , while armed , did not point the gun ; others said they had heard that there had been no gun at all , or that his hands had been in the air . A family friend , Kevin Blacks , 33 , said he was not surprised that the autopsy had found that Mr . Gray had been shot so many times or hit from behind . He said he had spoken to Mr . Gray \u2019 s parents . \u201c The dad is shook , \u201d Mr . Blacks said , standing by a makeshift memorial for Mr . Gray . \u201c He doesn \u2019 t sleep . He doesn \u2019 t talk . He \u2019 s still in a dream . \u201d Local elected officials and clergy members , seeking to lower the temperature in the neighborhood , mostly did not issue new statements Wednesday . \u201c Our focus right now is to get the funeral service together , \u201d said Gilford T . Monrose , a local pastor and community leader who is working with the family on the service ; a date had yet to be set , he said . On Tuesday , police investigators could be seen inside a Rite Aid store where , the night before , a group of at least three dozen mostly young people briefly rampaged through the aisles , turning over displays and assaulting one customer who tried to intervene .

Then came the anger : a Monday evening vigil marred by an unruly young mob thrashing its way through local businesses ; a second protest the next night ; and another on Wednesday night , after which , the police said , someone hit an officer in the face with a brick , another brick was thrown through the window of a police van , and there were 46 arrests \u2014 mostly for disorderly conduct . Two officers suffered minor injuries . By the time an autopsy of the 16 - year - old was released Wednesday , the tension in East Flatbush could be measured in the silently flashing lights of squad cars parked at tight intervals along Church Avenue . For some , the sight of extra police officers meant a potential reprieve in an area troubled by crime . For others , it was anything but reassuring . The police said that two plainclothes officers fatally shot the teenager , Kimani Gray , just before 11 : 30 p . m . on Saturday after he brandished a revolver and pointed it at them . The police commissioner , Raymond W . Kelly , said Tuesday that the police had interviewed three witnesses , \u201c two of which say that the officers said , \u2018 Don \u2019 t move . \u2019 \u201d \u201c Another witness said an officer says , \u2018 Freeze , \u2019 \u201d he said . The officers then fired 11 shots , the police said . Seven bullets hit Mr . Gray , including three that entered his body from the rear , according to the New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner . The autopsy did not establish the order in which the bullets struck Mr . Gray , or determine the path of the bullets , which might make clearer if Mr . Gray had his back to the officers when he was shot , or if he had twisted away after being struck from the front . But the findings , inconclusive though they were , appeared likely to heighten the tensions of a community already distrustful of the police and increasingly incensed about the shooting of the teenager . On Wednesday night , about 200 people attended the vigil . The gathering became unruly when about half of them splintered off and marched to a nearby police precinct station house . After officers in riot gear set up a roadblock on Church Avenue , Mr . Gray \u2019 s sister Mahnefah tried to cross the street and was put into a police car . She was given a summons and released . Some of the protesters shouted , \u201c That \u2019 s the sister , \u201d then started throwing bottles when the police would not release her . Someone hurled a chair . Screams could be heard as skirmishes broke out on side streets . For local residents , many of whom voiced skepticism about the official account , the situation surrounding Mr . Gray \u2019 s death was grimly familiar . Less than a year before , and only blocks away , a narcotics detective shot and killed an unarmed 23 - year - old woman , Shantel Davis , as she tried to flee the police in a car that had been reported stolen at gunpoint , the police said at the time . Vigils followed that shooting as well . But soon the rhythms of daily life returned , marked by what young men and women said was a daily backbeat of police stops . \u201c You try to put it out of your mind , \u201d said Ms . Davis \u2019 s sister Crystal . In interviews around East Flatbush , many spoke of a Police Department that , in its aggressive pursuit of gangs and informal criminal crews , had sown distrust , especially among young men and women , who feel that their encounters with officers often have racial overtones . At a barbershop along Church Avenue , two men on Tuesday were discussing the recent shooting when an Asian delivery cyclist pulled onto the sidewalk across the street . \u201c See that guy ? \u201d said Elverton Thomas , 39 , a black man and telemarketer who was there for a haircut . \u201c He can ride on the sidewalk . We can \u2019 t . \u201d His barber , Julian Clark , also black , concurred . Two years before , he said , an officer stopped him in front of the shop for sidewalk riding , and then arrested him after the officer said his identification had expired ; he spent a day in custody sorting it out , he said . \u201c They have a hard time because there \u2019 s a lot of crime in the neighborhood , \u201d he said of the police . \u201c But when they play hardball , they end up going after innocent people , too . \u201d The seemingly constant presence of the police in the lives of many youths \u2014 both on the street and , increasingly , monitoring conversations on social media \u2014 has left many feeling suffocated , said Shanduke McPhatter , 35 , an ex - gang member who works with young men in the neighborhood . \u201c I understand the state of mind that these youths have , \u201d he said . \u201c The problem is there is no relationship with the police . \u201d At the same time , he said , the situation on the streets has grown more complex for law enforcement : gangs are less organized , replaced instead by informal crews with few requirements and in which leadership is frequently up for grabs among increasingly young members . \u201c The police say , \u2018 Look at these kids , they \u2019 re wild , \u2019 \u201d Mr . McPhatter said . \u201c And then they use that as an excuse to be wild themselves . \u201d The Rev .

Then came the anger : a Monday evening vigil marred by an unruly young mob thrashing its way through local businesses ; a second protest the next night ; and another on Wednesday night , after which , the police said , someone hit an officer in the face with a brick , another brick was thrown through the window of a police van , and there were 46 arrests \u2014 mostly for disorderly conduct . Two officers suffered minor injuries . By the time an autopsy of the 16 - year - old was released Wednesday , the tension in East Flatbush could be measured in the silently flashing lights of squad cars parked at tight intervals along Church Avenue . For some , the sight of extra police officers meant a potential reprieve in an area troubled by crime . For others , it was anything but reassuring . The police said that two plainclothes officers fatally shot the teenager , Kimani Gray , just before 11 : 30 p . m . on Saturday after he brandished a revolver and pointed it at them . The police commissioner , Raymond W . Kelly , said Tuesday that the police had interviewed three witnesses , \u201c two of which say that the officers said , \u2018 Don \u2019 t move . \u2019 \u201d \u201c Another witness said an officer says , \u2018 Freeze , \u2019 \u201d he said . The officers then fired 11 shots , the police said . Seven bullets hit Mr . Gray , including three that entered his body from the rear , according to the New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner . The autopsy did not establish the order in which the bullets struck Mr . Gray , or determine the path of the bullets , which might make clearer if Mr . Gray had his back to the officers when he was shot , or if he had twisted away after being struck from the front . But the findings , inconclusive though they were , appeared likely to heighten the tensions of a community already distrustful of the police and increasingly incensed about the shooting of the teenager . On Wednesday night , about 200 people attended the vigil . The gathering became unruly when about half of them splintered off and marched to a nearby police precinct station house . After officers in riot gear set up a roadblock on Church Avenue , Mr . Gray \u2019 s sister Mahnefah tried to cross the street and was put into a police car . She was given a summons and released . Some of the protesters shouted , \u201c That \u2019 s the sister , \u201d then started throwing bottles when the police would not release her . Someone hurled a chair . Screams could be heard as skirmishes broke out on side streets . For local residents , many of whom voiced skepticism about the official account , the situation surrounding Mr . Gray \u2019 s death was grimly familiar . Less than a year before , and only blocks away , a narcotics detective shot and killed an unarmed 23 - year - old woman , Shantel Davis , as she tried to flee the police in a car that had been reported stolen at gunpoint , the police said at the time . Vigils followed that shooting as well . But soon the rhythms of daily life returned , marked by what young men and women said was a daily backbeat of police stops . \u201c You try to put it out of your mind , \u201d said Ms . Davis \u2019 s sister Crystal . In interviews around East Flatbush , many spoke of a Police Department that , in its aggressive pursuit of gangs and informal criminal crews , had sown distrust , especially among young men and women , who feel that their encounters with officers often have racial overtones . At a barbershop along Church Avenue , two men on Tuesday were discussing the recent shooting when an Asian delivery cyclist pulled onto the sidewalk across the street . \u201c See that guy ? \u201d said Elverton Thomas , 39 , a black man and telemarketer who was there for a haircut . \u201c He can ride on the sidewalk . We can \u2019 t . \u201d His barber , Julian Clark , also black , concurred . Two years before , he said , an officer stopped him in front of the shop for sidewalk riding , and then arrested him after the officer said his identification had expired ; he spent a day in custody sorting it out , he said . \u201c They have a hard time because there \u2019 s a lot of crime in the neighborhood , \u201d he said of the police . \u201c But when they play hardball , they end up going after innocent people , too . \u201d The seemingly constant presence of the police in the lives of many youths \u2014 both on the street and , increasingly , monitoring conversations on social media \u2014 has left many feeling suffocated , said Shanduke McPhatter , 35 , an ex - gang member who works with young men in the neighborhood . \u201c I understand the state of mind that these youths have , \u201d he said . \u201c The problem is there is no relationship with the police . \u201d At the same time , he said , the situation on the streets has grown more complex for law enforcement : gangs are less organized , replaced instead by informal crews with few requirements and in which leadership is frequently up for grabs among increasingly young members . \u201c The police say , \u2018 Look at these kids , they \u2019 re wild , \u2019 \u201d Mr . McPhatter said . \u201c And then they use that as an excuse to be wild themselves . \u201d The Rev . Terry Lee , who runs a local youth ministry and acts as a liaison to the police , said many of the neighborhood shootings involved \u201c kids killing kids \u201d and lamented that the community did not rise up more frequently in anger over those shootings . But he said he understood why . \u201c The community we \u2019 re living in can get dangerous at times , \u201d he said . \u201c People are afraid of retaliation . \u201d Mr . Lee said the local 67th Precinct had grown more open to the community in recent years . \u201c The problem is , people still don \u2019 t want to go to the police , \u201d he said . The autopsy report on Mr . Gray did not specify which of the seven bullets caused the death of the teenager ; that determination awaits further investigation . One bullet entered his left shoulder in the rear ; two other bullets struck the back of his thighs , one in the left thigh and one in the right . Two bullets struck from the front , hitting his right thigh ; one bullet entered his left side , striking his lower rib cage ; and the last bullet hit his left lower forearm . John C . Cerar , the former commander for firearms training at the Police Department , said many factors could explain the wounds to the front and back of Mr . Gray \u2019 s body . \u201c Most of the time , it \u2019 s the person making a turn , or the position of the officers , \u201d he said , or some combination of the two . Once that person has a gun , he said , the threat to the officers is imminent . Mr . Gray \u2019 s revolver was loaded with four bullets , the police said . Mr . Kelly , the police commissioner , said Tuesday that there was \u201c nothing to indicate that this shooting was outside the guidelines . \u201d Mr . Cerar concurred , saying , \u201c Under the reported circumstances , it appears to be a good shooting . \u201d But raw feeling in the neighborhood fueled accounts at wide variance with that provided by the police . Some said Mr . Gray , while armed , did not point the gun ; others said they had heard that there had been no gun at all , or that his hands had been in the air . A family friend , Kevin Blacks , 33 , said he was not surprised that the autopsy had found that Mr . Gray had been shot so many times or hit from behind . He said he had spoken to Mr .

By the time an autopsy of the 16 - year - old was released Wednesday , the tension in East Flatbush could be measured in the silently flashing lights of squad cars parked at tight intervals along Church Avenue . For some , the sight of extra police officers meant a potential reprieve in an area troubled by crime . For others , it was anything but reassuring . The police said that two plainclothes officers fatally shot the teenager , Kimani Gray , just before 11 : 30 p . m . on Saturday after he brandished a revolver and pointed it at them . The police commissioner , Raymond W . Kelly , said Tuesday that the police had interviewed three witnesses , \u201c two of which say that the officers said , \u2018 Don \u2019 t move . \u2019 \u201d \u201c Another witness said an officer says , \u2018 Freeze , \u2019 \u201d he said . The officers then fired 11 shots , the police said . Seven bullets hit Mr . Gray , including three that entered his body from the rear , according to the New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner . The autopsy did not establish the order in which the bullets struck Mr . Gray , or determine the path of the bullets , which might make clearer if Mr . Gray had his back to the officers when he was shot , or if he had twisted away after being struck from the front . But the findings , inconclusive though they were , appeared likely to heighten the tensions of a community already distrustful of the police and increasingly incensed about the shooting of the teenager . On Wednesday night , about 200 people attended the vigil . The gathering became unruly when about half of them splintered off and marched to a nearby police precinct station house . After officers in riot gear set up a roadblock on Church Avenue , Mr . Gray \u2019 s sister Mahnefah tried to cross the street and was put into a police car . She was given a summons and released . Some of the protesters shouted , \u201c That \u2019 s the sister , \u201d then started throwing bottles when the police would not release her . Someone hurled a chair . Screams could be heard as skirmishes broke out on side streets . For local residents , many of whom voiced skepticism about the official account , the situation surrounding Mr . Gray \u2019 s death was grimly familiar . Less than a year before , and only blocks away , a narcotics detective shot and killed an unarmed 23 - year - old woman , Shantel Davis , as she tried to flee the police in a car that had been reported stolen at gunpoint , the police said at the time . Vigils followed that shooting as well . But soon the rhythms of daily life returned , marked by what young men and women said was a daily backbeat of police stops . \u201c You try to put it out of your mind , \u201d said Ms . Davis \u2019 s sister Crystal . In interviews around East Flatbush , many spoke of a Police Department that , in its aggressive pursuit of gangs and informal criminal crews , had sown distrust , especially among young men and women , who feel that their encounters with officers often have racial overtones . At a barbershop along Church Avenue , two men on Tuesday were discussing the recent shooting when an Asian delivery cyclist pulled onto the sidewalk across the street . \u201c See that guy ? \u201d said Elverton Thomas , 39 , a black man and telemarketer who was there for a haircut . \u201c He can ride on the sidewalk . We can \u2019 t . \u201d His barber , Julian Clark , also black , concurred . Two years before , he said , an officer stopped him in front of the shop for sidewalk riding , and then arrested him after the officer said his identification had expired ; he spent a day in custody sorting it out , he said . \u201c They have a hard time because there \u2019 s a lot of crime in the neighborhood , \u201d he said of the police . \u201c But when they play hardball , they end up going after innocent people , too . \u201d The seemingly constant presence of the police in the lives of many youths \u2014 both on the street and , increasingly , monitoring conversations on social media \u2014 has left many feeling suffocated , said Shanduke McPhatter , 35 , an ex - gang member who works with young men in the neighborhood . \u201c I understand the state of mind that these youths have , \u201d he said . \u201c The problem is there is no relationship with the police . \u201d At the same time , he said , the situation on the streets has grown more complex for law enforcement : gangs are less organized , replaced instead by informal crews with few requirements and in which leadership is frequently up for grabs among increasingly young members . \u201c The police say , \u2018 Look at these kids , they \u2019 re wild , \u2019 \u201d Mr . McPhatter said . \u201c And then they use that as an excuse to be wild themselves . \u201d The Rev . Terry Lee , who runs a local youth ministry and acts as a liaison to the police , said many of the neighborhood shootings involved \u201c kids killing kids \u201d and lamented that the community did not rise up more frequently in anger over those shootings . But he said he understood why . \u201c The community we \u2019 re living in can get dangerous at times , \u201d he said . \u201c People are afraid of retaliation . \u201d Mr . Lee said the local 67th Precinct had grown more open to the community in recent years . \u201c The problem is , people still don \u2019 t want to go to the police , \u201d he said . The autopsy report on Mr . Gray did not specify which of the seven bullets caused the death of the teenager ; that determination awaits further investigation . One bullet entered his left shoulder in the rear ; two other bullets struck the back of his thighs , one in the left thigh and one in the right . Two bullets struck from the front , hitting his right thigh ; one bullet entered his left side , striking his lower rib cage ; and the last bullet hit his left lower forearm . John C . Cerar , the former commander for firearms training at the Police Department , said many factors could explain the wounds to the front and back of Mr . Gray \u2019 s body . \u201c Most of the time , it \u2019 s the person making a turn , or the position of the officers , \u201d he said , or some combination of the two . Once that person has a gun , he said , the threat to the officers is imminent . Mr . Gray \u2019 s revolver was loaded with four bullets , the police said . Mr . Kelly , the police commissioner , said Tuesday that there was \u201c nothing to indicate that this shooting was outside the guidelines . \u201d Mr . Cerar concurred , saying , \u201c Under the reported circumstances , it appears to be a good shooting . \u201d But raw feeling in the neighborhood fueled accounts at wide variance with that provided by the police . Some said Mr . Gray , while armed , did not point the gun ; others said they had heard that there had been no gun at all , or that his hands had been in the air . A family friend , Kevin Blacks , 33 , said he was not surprised that the autopsy had found that Mr . Gray had been shot so many times or hit from behind . He said he had spoken to Mr . Gray \u2019 s parents . \u201c The dad is shook , \u201d Mr . Blacks said , standing by a makeshift memorial for Mr . Gray . \u201c He doesn \u2019 t sleep . He doesn \u2019 t talk . He \u2019 s still in a dream . \u201d Local elected officials and clergy members , seeking to lower the temperature in the neighborhood , mostly did not issue new statements Wednesday . \u201c Our focus right now is to get the funeral service together , \u201d said Gilford T . Monrose , a local pastor and community leader who is working with the family on the service ; a date had yet to be set , he said . On Tuesday , police investigators could be seen inside a Rite Aid store where , the night before , a group of at least three dozen mostly young people briefly rampaged through the aisles , turning over displays and assaulting one customer who tried to intervene . The police released store surveillance video and later announced the arrest of a 19 - year - old , saying he was one of three who hit the customer and took his cellphone . \u201c Nothing justifies that , \u201d Mr . Kelly said . He said at a City Council hearing on Tuesday that the violence had been caused by a disorderly group that broke away from the vigil and did not constitute a riot , as some had termed it . \u201c That belittles it , \u201d City Councilman Jumaane D .

Vodafone Egypt said some users are continuing to face slight problems due to damage in Telecom Egypt's cables which began in central Cairo . \"Vodafone , along with the country's three telecom providers has been affected by a damage in one of Telecom Egypt's fiber cables in a wire going from the Ramsis Communications Center all the way to Sadat City , \" said Khaled Hegazy , Vodafone's external affairs director . \"This has affected and continues to affect communications especially in parts of Alexandria and Suez governorates , \" he said . \"We have not been told when it will be fixed yet , it is in the hands of Telecom Egypt . Right now it is still slightly affecting some connections , \" he added . On its Twitter account , Etisalat Misr said , \"Customers on all three Egyptian mobile operators may currently face connection issues with voice , mobile internet , and / or BlackBerry services as a result of a damaged fiber cable from TE Data . \"The issue is currently under investigation and services will be restored as soon as possible . \" According to MyBroadband , the largest IT website in South Africa , the problem was attributed to downtime experienced by the pan - African ICT enabler SEACOM . The company which is a privately funded venture that owns and operates a submarine fiber - optic cable connecting communication carriers in south and east Africa , affected Mobinil , Vodafone , and Etisalat networks across parts of Alexandria and Suez . \"We are seeing some problems in our telecom towers which are affecting only certain parts like Abu Qir district or Maamoura , for example , \" a Mobinil customer service representative told Daily News Egypt . \"Other than that , our clients have been calling us as usual . \" A Vodafone customer representative also confirmed that some of their users were experiencing downtime in parts of Alexandria due to \"minor technical difficulties . \" According to SEACOM , the problems began at around 08 : 30 am on Tuesday , and were resolved at approximately 09 : 40 . \"SEACOM's partner network experienced a terrestrial fiber cut between Alexandria and the Suez this morning 16th August from 06 : 31GMT .

Deputies said that Orozco is 5 - foot - 8 , 135 pounds , with tattoos of \"devil's horns\" on his forehead and other tattoos over his upper body . They said he is a gang member known by the nickname \"Sepy . \" Ortiz , who had hoped to become a detective soon , had worked for the Sheriff's Department for 15 years and was known as an extremely hard worker whose job was to penetrate the inner workings of local gangs .

Sheriff's deputies fanned out across Hawaiian Gardens late Friday in search of the gunman , who apparently surprised Deputy Jerry Ortiz , 35 , as he spoke to the woman in the doorway of her apartment . Authorities said Ortiz probably died instantly . \"This was an assassination of a deputy , \" Sheriff Lee Baca said . \"It was a sudden attack that gave the deputy no chance . \" Deputies identified the suspect as Jose Luis Orozco , 27 , a parolee wanted on suspicion of attempted murder in another case . \"He should be considered armed and very dangerous , \" said sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore . Deputies said that Orozco is 5 - foot - 8 , 135 pounds , with tattoos of \"devil's horns\" on his forehead and other tattoos over his upper body . They said he is a gang member known by the nickname \"Sepy . \" Ortiz , who had hoped to become a detective soon , had worked for the Sheriff's Department for 15 years and was known as an extremely hard worker whose job was to penetrate the inner workings of local gangs . The Diamond Bar resident was married two weeks ago to his second wife , Chela . He is also survived by two sons , ages 6 and 16 . Last year , Ortiz won the department's Medal of Honor after he fatally shot a carjacker who drew a gun on him and his partner , Det . Colin Orpe . \"He was an outstanding person , who would go out of his way to help people , \" said Orpe , a longtime friend . \"We're all mourning , \" he said , choking back tears . The shooting occurred about 3 : 10 p . m . in the 12200 block of 223rd Street in Hawaiian Gardens , a working - class city at the northeastern border of Long Beach that has long been plagued by gang violence . The town of 14 , 000 has struggled economically in recent years , luring a casino to help balance its shaky finances . Ortiz's body was discovered by residents who heard the gunfire .

Deputy on Gang Duty June 25 , 2005 A Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy interviewing a woman and a man outside a Hawaiian Gardens apartment was fatally shot Friday when a gunman burst out of the residence , put a handgun to the officer's face and fired , authorities said . Sheriff's deputies fanned out across Hawaiian Gardens late Friday in search of the gunman , who apparently surprised Deputy Jerry Ortiz , 35 , as he spoke to the woman in the doorway of her apartment . Authorities said Ortiz probably died instantly . \"This was an assassination of a deputy , \" Sheriff Lee Baca said . \"It was a sudden attack that gave the deputy no chance . \" Deputies identified the suspect as Jose Luis Orozco , 27 , a parolee wanted on suspicion of attempted murder in another case . \"He should be considered armed and very dangerous , \" said sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore . Deputies said that Orozco is 5 - foot - 8 , 135 pounds , with tattoos of \"devil's horns\" on his forehead and other tattoos over his upper body . They said he is a gang member known by the nickname \"Sepy . \" Ortiz , who had hoped to become a detective soon , had worked for the Sheriff's Department for 15 years and was known as an extremely hard worker whose job was to penetrate the inner workings of local gangs . The Diamond Bar resident was married two weeks ago to his second wife , Chela . He is also survived by two sons , ages 6 and 16 . Last year , Ortiz won the department's Medal of Honor after he fatally shot a carjacker who drew a gun on him and his partner , Det . Colin Orpe . \"He was an outstanding person , who would go out of his way to help people , \" said Orpe , a longtime friend . \"We're all mourning , \" he said , choking back tears . The shooting occurred about 3 : 10 p . m . in the 12200 block of 223rd Street in Hawaiian Gardens , a working - class city at the northeastern border of Long Beach that has long been plagued by gang violence . The town of 14 , 000 has struggled economically in recent years , luring a casino to help balance its shaky finances . Ortiz's body was discovered by residents who heard the gunfire . They tried to aid the deputy and dialed 911 , authorities said . Ortiz was working without his longtime partner at the time of the attack . Undersheriff Larry Waldie said Ortiz had arrived for work early , as he often did , and was so eager to begin his day that he struck out on his own . \"He didn't want to wait , \" Waldie said . Asked if Ortiz might have lived had his partner been with him , Waldie said there was no way to know . \"There might have been two people killed , \" he said . The shooting was followed by confusion as scores of deputies descended on the area with dogs and rifles but little knowledge of what had occurred . A sheriff's SWAT team encircled the apartment complex where it was believed that the gunman could be hiding . Patrol deputies detained as many as nine potential witnesses and others in an effort to learn details of the shooting . Nearly all of them were rounded up in a liquor store next to the apartment complex . Television news footage showed the men and women sitting on the curb in handcuffs as deputies interviewed them and swabbed their hands for possible gunshot residue .", "e0": "fired", "e1": "in", "e0_pos": [348, 353], "e1_pos": [441, 443], "lab": "EFFECT"}

Anthony LaCalamita III , 38 , had been arrested following a high - speed chase a few hours after the Monday morning shootings at Gordon Advisors in suburban Detroit . During his arraignment Wednesday , authorities described what witnesses saw inside the offices that morning . LaCalamita was hiding the gun when he walked into accounting firm offices , stopped briefly at the reception desk and then entered Alan Steinberg's office , Troy police Sgt . Barry Whiteside testified . Steinberg , a partner in the firm , told police LaCalamita loaded a shell into the shotgun's chamber and shot him in the hip , then walked toward the office of Paul Riva , another partner . When receptionist Madeline Kafoury tried to stop him at Riva's door , the gunman fatally shot her in the midsection , Whiteside said . LaCalamita then fired at Riva , hitting him in the upper chest , and left the building , Whiteside said . Riva had yet to regain consciousness Wednesday and was on a ventilator , police said . As Whiteside talked in court , Kafoury's adult daughter sobbed uncontrollably . \"She wasn't just a receptionist . . . . She was our mom and the grandmother of our children , \" Kafoury's son , Charlie , said after the hearing . \"She was an essential point of our lives . \" Not guilty pleas were entered on LaCalamita's behalf to charges of first - degree murder , intent to murder , possession of a firearm in the commission of a felony and fleeing and eluding police . Asked by the judge if he understood the charges against him and if he was aware that he could be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole if convicted of first - degree murder , he responded \"Yes . \" The judge ordered him held without bail pending his next court hearing April 19 . Troy police Lt . Gerry Scherlinck said Riva and Steinberg appeared to have been the targets in the shootings . LaCalamita had been fired last Thursday as a general accountant at the firm and bought a shotgun and shells on Friday , Scherlinck said . He said police found a box consistent with one that would hold a shotgun , as well as empty shell boxes , in a Dumpster outside LaCalamita's apartment Monday evening . When LaCalamita was arrested , police said they found a 12 - gauge pump - action shotgun and three shells in his vehicle . Matthew Roth , executive staff attorney for the prosecutor's office , said his office had not been told if LaCalamita or his family had retained a lawyer . LaCalamita is married , but his wife , Michele , released a statement saying they had been separated for about three weeks .

During his arraignment Wednesday , authorities described what witnesses saw inside the offices that morning . LaCalamita was hiding the gun when he walked into accounting firm offices , stopped briefly at the reception desk and then entered Alan Steinberg's office , Troy police Sgt . Barry Whiteside testified . Steinberg , a partner in the firm , told police LaCalamita loaded a shell into the shotgun's chamber and shot him in the hip , then walked toward the office of Paul Riva , another partner . When receptionist Madeline Kafoury tried to stop him at Riva's door , the gunman fatally shot her in the midsection , Whiteside said .

Less than six months after South Sudan broke away from Sudan , an act that was the culmination of a peace accord to end decades of civil war , tensions between the neighbors are crystallizing into fears of direct confrontation . Speaking in South Sudan's capital , Juba , Mr . Kiir denounced the Sudanese government for threatening what he called a \"military invasion\" of South Sudan , and he rejected accusations by the Sudanese government that his country was arming Sudanese rebels as \"utterly baseless and malicious . \" Mr . Kiir has also accused the Sudanese government of bombing the South Sudanese area of Guffa in recent days , killing at least seven people and potentially moving the insurgencies on both sides of the border closer to an international conflict . The United States issued a statement on Thursday condemning \"in the strongest possible terms\" what it called \"negative developments\" between the nations , particularly the airstrike by the Sudanese forces . \"The provocative aerial bombardments near the border increase the potential of direct confrontation between Sudan and South Sudan , \" the American statement said . Sudan has denied striking South Sudanese territory . Nevertheless , on Thursday afternoon an Antonov bomber dropped four bombs on the South Sudanese area of Yida , hitting a refugee camp of roughly 21 , 000 people , some of them northern Sudanese who had crossed the border since the rebellion in Sudan began . According to an aid worker with knowledge of the event , two bombs fell on an airstrip , one hit a school and one landed on a market , but did not detonate . There were varying reports of casualties , but none could be confirmed . While the two nations continue to discuss how to split lucrative oil revenues and the fate of the contested region of Abyei , a spreading rebellion inside Sudan has prompted the Sudanese government to accuse the south of providing military support to the rebels . Last week , the Sudanese government lodged a formal complaint with the United Nations Security Council , arguing that South Sudan was trying to start a border war . \"We don't have any intention to go to war again , but it is now up to the southern government to either strengthen its state without hostility , or to disturb us , \" said a Sudanese government spokesman , Rabie A . Atti . \"If they come to war , they will lose a lot . \" Many residents in the Sudanese provinces of Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile fought alongside the south during its civil war with the north . But the 2005 peace treaty placed the two provinces in Sudan's territory , leaving South Sudan to hold a referendum to decide its own fate . In January , the South Sudanese voted almost unanimously to secede from the rest of the country . Their fellow combatants in Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile remained on the other side of the border , and an armed rebellion soon began . \"We are ready to fight and continue until we reach Khartoum , \" the Sudanese capital , said one of the rebel leaders , Abdel Aziz al - Hilu , in a September interview . \"We are prepared for a protracted war , a long war , \" he added , \"in order to see this regime ousted . \" In return , the Sudanese military has clamped down hard on the rebellion , filling the skies over Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile with Antonov bombers , some of which have flown over South Sudanese territory , too . A satellite imaging project organized by the Enough Project , an advocacy group , has published what it says is evidence of mass graves in the rebellious regions , and the United Nations has said the military activity could amount to war crimes . The United States , a close partner of South Sudan , had made strong overtures to the government in Sudan , saying that if it cooperated peacefully with South Sudan's transition to independence , economic sanctions on the country could be lifted . But last week , President Obama seemed to change his mind , calling for sanctions to be extended over what he called \"hostile\" actions on the part of the Sudanese government that posed an \"unusual and extraordinary threat\" to American foreign policy . \"They promised us a lot of things ; nothing actually implemented , \" said Mr . Atti , the Sudanese government spokesman . \"It's unfair . \" South Sudan - or Sudan - can ill afford a new war . The economies of both nations are in a delicate state , with Sudan suffering from a loss of oil income since South Sudan's independence , and protests springing up in the streets of Khartoum early this year . As for South Sudan , it is one of the least developed countries in the world . Furthermore , it faces a number of internal rebellions itself , particularly in provinces near the border , and it has accused the Sudanese government of backing militias there . \"The overall view is that they have to exist with the other side , \" said Aly Verjee , a senior researcher at the Rift Valley Institute . \"Even if you don't trust them so much , and if they are meddling in your own sovereign territory , there is a lot riding on that . \"", "e0": "Bombing", "e1": "detonate", "e0_pos": [176, 183], "e1_pos": [2047, 2055], "lab": "EFFECT"}
